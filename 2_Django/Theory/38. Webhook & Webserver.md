# Webhooks Overview

## 1. What is it?
A webhook is a way for one system to send real-time data to another system via an HTTP POST request when a specific event occurs.

## 2. Why it matters?
It allows automatic, event-driven communication between services without polling or manual checks.

## 3. How it works?
When an event happens (e.g., payment completed), the source system sends a POST request with data to a target URL (your endpoint).

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a doorbell — when someone presses it (event), it instantly notifies the house (your server).

## 5. When to use it?
Use it for real-time updates like payment status (e.g., Stripe), GitHub pushes, form submissions, etc.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Instant updates, low overhead  
❌ Needs secure handling and can fail if the target server is down

## 7. Related Concepts
API, HTTP POST, event-driven systems, callbacks

## 8. Conclusion
Webhooks enable real-time communication between systems — ideal for triggering actions automatically when events occur.

# Web Server Overview

## 1. What is it?
A web server is a software that handles HTTP requests from clients (like browsers) and serves web content (HTML, JSON, etc.).

## 2. Why it matters?
It acts as the bridge between users and your web application, ensuring requests are received and responses are delivered.

## 3. How it works?
When a user visits a URL, the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) listens for the request, processes it (or forwards it), and returns a response.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a waiter in a restaurant — takes your request (menu order), gets it from the kitchen (app), and brings it to your table (browser).

## 5. When to use it?
Always — it's a core part of web app deployment, used to serve static files, forward requests to app servers, and manage load.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Efficient, scalable, essential for hosting  
❌ Needs configuration and security hardening

## 7. Related Concepts
Nginx, Apache, Gunicorn, reverse proxy, HTTP, ports

## 8. Conclusion
A web server is the foundation of web app deployment, responsible for handling and routing web traffic.

# Proxy Server Overview

## 1. What is it?
A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet.

## 2. Why it matters?
It provides privacy, access control, and can bypass geolocation restrictions or firewalls.

## 3. How it works?
The client sends requests to the proxy, which then sends them to the target server and returns the response.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like browsing the internet at school — your traffic goes through a school-managed proxy server, which can block or monitor what you access, like Facebook or YouTube.

## 5. When to use it?
When you want to hide client identity, control access, or monitor outgoing traffic.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Enhances privacy and control  
❌ Can be blocked or slow if overloaded

## 7. Related Concepts
VPN, firewall, content filtering, corporate networks

## 8. Conclusion
A proxy server is mainly for client-side use, helping users access content anonymously or securely.

# Reverse Proxy Overview

## 1. What is it?
A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and handles client requests on their behalf.

## 2. Why it matters?
It provides load balancing, security, SSL termination, and caching for backend applications like Django.

## 3. How it works?
Clients connect to the reverse proxy, which forwards the request to one of the backend servers and returns the response.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a receptionist for a company — screens requests and routes them to the right person/server.

## 5. When to use it?
In production setups (e.g., Django + Gunicorn + Nginx) to manage traffic and protect internal servers.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Improves performance, security, and scalability  
❌ Adds configuration complexity

## 7. Related Concepts
Nginx, Apache, load balancer, SSL offloading, CDN

## 8. Conclusion
A reverse proxy is essential for server-side protection and optimization, especially in production web apps.

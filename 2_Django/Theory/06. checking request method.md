# Checking Request Method in Django

## 1. What is it?
It's a way to determine whether the incoming HTTP request is a GET, POST, PUT, etc.

## 2. Why it matters?
You often need to run different logic based on the request type ‚Äî like showing a form on GET and processing it on POST.

## 3. How it works?
Django‚Äôs request object has a `.method` attribute: `request.method == 'POST'` or `'GET'`.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like checking if someone is knocking (GET = asking) or handing you a form (POST = submitting).

## 5. When to use it?
Use in function-based views or inside `dispatch()` in class-based views to branch logic by method.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Simple and direct ‚ùå Manual branching can get messy in complex views ‚Äî class-based views handle this cleaner

## 7. Related Concepts
CSRF protection, `request.GET`, `request.POST`, decorators like `@require_http_methods`

## 8. Conclusion
Checking `request.method` is essential for handling form submissions and conditional request logic in Django views.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def my_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle form submission
        pass
    else:
        # Show empty form
        pass
```

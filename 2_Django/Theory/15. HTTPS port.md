# HTTPS Port

## 1. What is it?
The HTTPS port is used to send and receive secure, encrypted website data.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures encrypted and secure communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive data.

## 3. How it works?
When a browser connects to a server using `https://`, it defaults to port **443**, and establishes a TLS handshake before transferring data.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like using a locked mailbox (port 443) instead of an open one (port 80 for HTTP) to protect your letters.

## 5. When to use it?
Always use HTTPS (port 443) when transmitting sensitive data like passwords, payments, or personal info.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Provides confidentiality and data integrity ‚ùå Requires SSL certificates and setup

## 7. Related Concepts
HTTP (port 80), TLS/SSL, certificates, HTTPS redirection, reverse proxy

## 8. Conclusion
Port 443 is the standard for HTTPS, enabling safe, encrypted web communication.

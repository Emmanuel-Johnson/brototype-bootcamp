# Reverse Proxy

## 1. What is it?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more backend servers and forwards client requests to them.

## 2. Why it matters?

It adds a layer of abstraction and control, enabling load balancing, security, caching, and SSL termination.

## 3. How it works?

Clients send requests to the reverse proxy → it decides which backend server should handle it → forwards the request and sends back the response.

## 4. Example/Analogy

Like a receptionist who receives all incoming calls and directs them to the right person internally.

## 5. When to use it?

Use it for scaling apps, protecting backend servers, managing multiple services under one domain, or implementing HTTPS termination.

## 6. Pros and Cons

✅ Improves performance, security, scalability
❌ Adds complexity and potential single point of failure

## 7. Related Concepts

Load balancer, Nginx, Apache, API gateway, CDN, forward proxy

## 8. Conclusion

A reverse proxy acts as a smart gatekeeper, handling client requests efficiently while shielding backend systems.

# ✅ Common Use Cases

- Serving Django apps behind Nginx or Apache
- Forwarding traffic to Gunicorn, Uvicorn, or Daphne
- Terminating HTTPS (SSL certificates only on proxy)
- Caching static files and reducing backend load
- Rate-limiting or IP blocking for security

# Why is HTTP Stateless ?

## 1. What is it?  
HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent and does not retain user context from previous requests.

## 2. Why it matters?  
This behavior simplifies communication, but requires Django (or any web framework) to manage state manually — like user sessions or authentication.

## 3. How it works?  
When a client sends a request, Django receives it without any memory of prior interactions; it must rebuild context using things like cookies or sessions.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like ordering coffee where the cashier doesn’t remember you — you must explain your order every time unless you carry a loyalty card (session ID).

## 5. When to use it?  
Statelessness is always the default — it ensures scalability and reliability, but Django adds session handling when you need persistence (e.g., user login).

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Scales easily, simple protocol.  
❌ No built-in memory — must implement sessions or tokens for state.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Cookies, Sessions, Tokens, REST APIs, Django `request.session`.

## 8. Conclusion  
HTTP’s stateless nature is by design; Django works around it using tools like sessions to track users across requests.

# Django CSRF Token Overview

## 1. What is it?
A CSRF token is a unique, secret value included in forms to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures that form submissions come from trusted sources and not malicious third-party sites.

## 3. How it works?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls whether a web page from one origin can access resources from another. When your frontend makes a request to a different domain (cross-origin), the browser checks the server’s response for specific headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin. If the request is simple (like GET or POST with standard headers), the browser sends it directly and allows the response if the origin is permitted. For more complex requests (like PUT, DELETE, or custom headers), the browser first sends a preflight OPTIONS request to ask the server if it’s safe to proceed. The server must respond with allowed origins, methods, and headers; only then will the browser send the actual request. Without proper CORS headers, the browser blocks the response to protect the user.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a secret handshake between the client and server to confirm the action is legitimate.

## 5. When to use it?
Always in forms that perform POST, PUT, or DELETE actions in Django templates.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Protects against CSRF attacks  
❌ Requires careful handling in AJAX and external APIs

## 7. Related Concepts
`@csrf_protect`, `@csrf_exempt`, `X-CSRFToken` in AJAX, session management

## 8. Conclusion
CSRF tokens are essential for web security in Django, adding a critical layer of protection to user-submitted forms.

# Django CORS Overview

## 1. What is it?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which domains can access resources on your server.

## 2. Why it matters?
It protects your APIs from unauthorized access by restricting requests from unknown origins (domains).

## 3. How it works?
The server includes specific CORS headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) in its response; browsers use them to allow or block requests.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a guest list at a party — only approved websites (origins) can “talk” to your Django API.

## 5. When to use it?
When your frontend and backend are on different domains or ports (e.g., React frontend at `localhost:3000` and Django at `localhost:8000`).

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Enables secure cross-domain communication  
❌ Misconfiguration can expose your app to security risks

## 7. Related Concepts
`django-cors-headers`, Same-Origin Policy, preflight requests, HTTP headers

## 8. Conclusion
CORS is crucial for enabling frontend-backend integration across domains while maintaining browser-enforced security.

# IPv4 Overview

## 1. What is it?
IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify devices using a 32-bit address.

## 2. Why it matters?
It has been the dominant IP protocol for decades, enabling devices to communicate on the internet.

## 3. How it works?
Each device is assigned a unique 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), allowing data to be routed across networks.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a mailing address for your computer — routers use it to send data to the right place.

## 5. When to use it?
Still widely used in most networks today; supported by nearly all internet infrastructure.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Simple, widely supported  
❌ Limited address space (≈4.3 billion addresses), not future-proof

## 7. Related Concepts
Subnetting, NAT (Network Address Translation), DHCP

## 8. Conclusion
IPv4 is the traditional addressing system of the internet, but it's running out of space, leading to the rise of IPv6.

# IPv6 Overview

## 1. What is it?
IPv6 is the successor to IPv4, using 128-bit addresses to support a vastly larger number of unique IPs.

## 2. Why it matters?
It solves IPv4’s address exhaustion problem and introduces better efficiency and security features.

## 3. How it works?
Devices get a unique 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`), enabling trillions of possible IPs.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like giving every grain of sand on Earth its own address — that's how many devices IPv6 can handle.

## 5. When to use it?
Ideal for modern networks, IoT, and future-proofing internet infrastructure.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Huge address space, better routing, built-in security  
❌ Not fully adopted, older systems may lack support

## 7. Related Concepts
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), dual-stack, ICMPv6

## 8. Conclusion
IPv6 is the future of the internet, offering scalability and modern features, but coexists with IPv4 during transition.

# Rate Limiting in Django Overview

## 1. What is it?
Rate limiting controls how many requests a user or client can make to your Django app over a period of time.

## 2. Why it matters?
It protects your application from abuse, brute-force attacks, and helps manage server load.

## 3. How it works?
It tracks incoming requests per IP or user and blocks or delays further requests after a set threshold using middleware or decorators.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a ticket counter — each visitor can only get a limited number of tickets per hour to prevent overcrowding.

## 5. When to use it?
On login forms, API endpoints, or any sensitive action that could be abused with repeated requests.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Protects against abuse, improves reliability  
❌ Can block legit users if not configured carefully

## 7. Related Concepts
Throttling, `django-ratelimit`, DRF throttling classes, IP blocking, caching

## 8. Conclusion
Rate limiting is essential for securing Django apps and APIs — especially on endpoints prone to high traffic or attack.

## Popular Tools for Rate Limiting in Django

## django-ratelimit
For function- and class-based views:

```python
from ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='5/m', block=True)
def my_view(request):
    ...
```

## Django REST Framework (DRF) Throttling
In `settings.py`:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'user': '100/day',
    }
}
```

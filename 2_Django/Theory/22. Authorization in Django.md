# What is Authorization in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
Authorization in Django determines what a user is allowed to do — such as accessing views, editing data, or managing admin features.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps enforce permissions and roles, ensuring that users can only perform actions they are authorized for, enhancing security.

## 3. How it works?  
Django uses the built-in permissions framework, `@permission_required` decorators, `user.has_perm()`, and custom logic to check user access.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
If authentication is checking who you are, authorization is checking what you're allowed to do — like having a keycard for different doors.

## 5. When to use it?  
Always after authentication — especially for admin panels, user-specific data access, or APIs with role-based control.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Built-in permission system, customizable.  
❌ May require custom roles/groups logic for complex apps.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Authentication, Permissions, Groups, `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## 8. Conclusion  
Authorization in Django ensures users only access what they're permitted to — using built-in permissions or custom checks for fine-grained control.

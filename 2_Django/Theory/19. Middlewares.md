# What is Middleware in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
Middleware is a layer of software that processes requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after the response leaves the view.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows you to add reusable, cross-cutting functionality (like authentication, logging, security checks) without modifying individual views.

## 3. How it works?  
In Django, middleware components are classes that hook into the request/response cycle ‚Äî modifying requests before views or responses after views.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like security guards at a building entrance ‚Äî they check everyone before letting them in (request), and again on the way out (response).

## 5. When to use it?  
Use middleware when you need to apply logic across all or many requests, such as session handling, user authentication, or CORS headers.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
‚úÖ Centralized logic, reusable, clean code.  
‚ùå Order-sensitive, can affect performance if overused.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Request/Response Cycle, Django Settings, WSGI, Hooks, Decorators.

## 8. Conclusion  
Middleware acts like a global filter or processor for requests and responses, making it easy to implement features like authentication, logging, or error handling across your app.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    
    # ‚úÖ Your custom middleware (adjust path if needed)
    'core.middleware.RequestTimerMiddleware',

    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]

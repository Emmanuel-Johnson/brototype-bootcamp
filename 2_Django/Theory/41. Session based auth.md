# Django Session-Based Authentication

## 1. What is it?  
Session-based authentication is Django’s default method of tracking logged-in users using server-side sessions.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows users to stay logged in across multiple pages without re-authenticating on every request.

## 3. How it works?  
After login, Django creates a session ID and stores it in a cookie on the client; user data is stored server-side in the database.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like giving someone a visitor badge after login—only the system knows what that badge maps to.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use it for most standard web applications where the frontend and backend are tightly coupled.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Easy to use, secure server-side storage.  
❌ Doesn’t scale well for APIs or cross-domain apps.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Sessions, Cookies, CSRF, Token-based Auth (for APIs), request.user, LoginView.

## 8. Conclusion  
Django’s session-based auth is a simple, secure method for managing user login state in traditional web apps.

# Django Session-Based Authentication Flow

## Quick Flow Overview

1. **User logs in** via `LoginView` or custom view
2. Django authenticates using `authenticate()` and `login()` functions
3. A **session ID** is stored in the user's browser cookie
4. On every request, Django checks the session ID and attaches the user to `request.user`

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. User Login
- User submits credentials through Django's built-in `LoginView` or a custom authentication view
- Form data is processed and validated

### 2. Authentication
- Django uses the `authenticate()` function to verify user credentials
- If valid, the `login()` function is called to establish the session
- User object is retrieved and prepared for session storage

### 3. Session Creation
- Django generates a unique session ID
- Session data is stored server-side (database, cache, or file system)
- Session ID is sent to the browser as a cookie (typically named `sessionid`)

### 4. Request Processing
- On subsequent requests, Django middleware reads the session cookie
- Session ID is used to retrieve session data from storage
- User object is attached to `request.user` for use throughout the request cycle
- Authentication state persists until logout or session expiration

# DNS – Domain Name System

## 1. What is it?
DNS is the system that translates domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses (like `93.184.216.34`) that computers use to communicate.

## 2. Why it matters?
Without DNS, you'd need to remember IP addresses instead of easy-to-read domain names.

## 3. How it works?
When you enter a domain in your browser, your computer asks DNS servers to resolve it into an IP address. This process involves recursive and authoritative DNS servers.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a phonebook—lookup a person's name to get their number; DNS resolves domain names to IPs.

## 5. When to use it?
Always—anytime you access a website, DNS is involved behind the scenes.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Makes the internet user-friendly ❌ DNS attacks (like spoofing) can compromise security

## 7. Related Concepts
IP address, nameserver, A record, CNAME, TTL, DNS propagation, resolver

## 8. Conclusion
DNS is the backbone of web browsing—it connects human-friendly names to machine-friendly addresses.

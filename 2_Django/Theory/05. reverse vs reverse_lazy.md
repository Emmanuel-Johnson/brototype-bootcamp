# reverse

## 1. What is it?
`reverse()` is a Django utility that returns the URL path corresponding to a view name.

## 2. Why it matters?
It helps avoid hardcoding URLs, making your code DRY, consistent, and easy to maintain.

## 3. How it works?
You pass the view name (as defined in `urls.py`) and optional `args` or `kwargs`, and Django resolves it into a URL string.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like looking up someone‚Äôs phone number from their name ‚Äî you give the name, and Django finds the ‚Äúaddress‚Äù (URL).

## 5. When to use it?
Use it in views, `redirect()` functions, or any place where you need to dynamically generate a URL.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Prevents hardcoded URLs  
‚úÖ Refactors easily  
‚ùå Fails at import-time if used before URL config loads

## 7. Related Concepts
- `reverse_lazy`  
- `redirect()`  
- `resolve()`  
- Named URLs in `urls.py`

## 8. Conclusion
`reverse()` is essential for generating URLs dynamically and safely ‚Äî use it whenever you need a reliable reference to a view.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
# urls.py
path('products/<int:id>/', views.product_detail, name='product-detail')

# views.py
from django.urls import reverse
def go_to_product(request):
    url = reverse('product-detail', kwargs={'id': 42})
```

# reverse_lazy()

## 1. What is it?
`reverse_lazy()` is a lazy version of `reverse()` that delays URL resolution until it‚Äôs actually needed.

## 2. Why it matters?
It's useful in places where URL resolution happens before the URL configuration is fully loaded (e.g., at class attribute definition).

## 3. How it works?
Instead of returning a string immediately, it returns a lazy object that resolves to the actual URL when accessed.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like setting a reminder to ‚Äúget the address later‚Äù instead of trying to fetch it right now when it might not be available yet.

## 5. When to use it?
Use `reverse_lazy` in class-based views, forms, or settings where reverse resolution is needed at import time.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Safe for early evaluation (class attributes)  
‚ùå Can be confusing if you're expecting a string immediately

## 7. Related Concepts
- `reverse()`  
- `redirect()`  
- Class-based views (`success_url`)  
- Lazy evaluation

## 8. Conclusion
`reverse_lazy` is your go-to when working outside view functions ‚Äî it keeps URL resolution deferred and error-free during import time.



```python
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from .models import Product

class ProductCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Product
    fields = ['title', 'price']
    success_url = reverse_lazy('product-list')  # evaluated only when needed
```

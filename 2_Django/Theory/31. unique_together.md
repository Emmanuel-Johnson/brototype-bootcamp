# Django `unique_together` Overview

## 1. What is it?
`unique_together` is a Django model option that ensures a combination of fields must be unique in the database.

## 2. Why it matters?
It enforces compound uniqueness ‚Äî useful when individual fields can repeat but their combination must be unique.

## 3. How it works?
Defined in the model‚Äôs `Meta` class, Django adds a unique constraint at the database level for the specified field combination.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like allowing users to review different products, or allowing products to have reviews from different users ‚Äî but never allowing the same user to review the same product more than once

## 5. When to use it?
Use it when uniqueness depends on multiple fields ‚Äî e.g., no two users can review the same product twice.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Easy way to enforce multi-field constraints  
‚ùå Deprecated in favor of `UniqueConstraint` in newer Django versions

## 7. Related Concepts
`Meta.constraints`, `UniqueConstraint`, database-level integrity, form validation

## 8. Conclusion
`unique_together` ensures multi-field uniqueness and improves data integrity, but `UniqueConstraint` is now the preferred method.

## üîπ Practical Example

## **Old way (still works but deprecated):**
Using `unique_together` inside a model's `Meta` class:

```python
class MyModel(models.Model):
    field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    field2 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('field1', 'field2')  # ‚úÖ DEPRECATED
```

## **New recommended way:**
Using `UniqueConstraint` in `constraints` inside the `Meta` class:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    field2 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(fields=['field1', 'field2'], name='unique_field1_field2')
        ]
```

## üí° Why the change?

* `UniqueConstraint` is **more powerful and flexible**.
* It allows you to add additional options like `condition=`, `deferrable=`, and `name=`.
* It's part of Django's effort to move toward a **clearer and more consistent** constraint API.

## ‚úÖ Summary:
If you're using `unique_together`, Django will still recognize it, but **you should switch to using `UniqueConstraint`** because `unique_together` may be removed in future versions.

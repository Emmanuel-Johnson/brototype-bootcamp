JWT signature 

# JWT Signature

## 1. What is it?
The JWT Signature is the third part of the token used to verify that the token hasn’t been tampered with.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures integrity—the server can confirm the token is legitimate and unaltered.

## 3. How it works?
The server creates the signature by encoding the header and payload, then signing them using a secret key and algorithm like HS256.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a wax seal on a letter—it proves who sent it and whether it was opened or altered.

## 5. When to use it?
Always—without a signature, a JWT would be unsafe and anyone could forge or modify it.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Tamper-proof, lightweight ❌ If secret is exposed, the whole system is compromised

## 7. Related Concepts
HMAC, SHA-256, RSA, `alg` field in JWT header, private/public key signing

## 8. Conclusion
The signature is the security core of JWT—it protects against forgery and ensures trust in token-based authentication.

# 🔧 How JWT Signature is Created

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64urlEncode(header) + "." + base64urlEncode(payload),
  secret_key
)
```

* **Header** and **Payload** are base64-encoded
* A **secret key** (or private key) is used to generate the signature
* This ensures that only someone with the secret key can generate a valid token

## ✅ Example

```python
import jwt

# Sample data
header = {"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}
payload = {"user_id": 1}
secret = "my_secret_key"

# Encode (includes signature)
encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm="HS256")
print(encoded_jwt)
```

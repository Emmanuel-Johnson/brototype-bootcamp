# 🔐 HTTP 401 – Unauthorized

## 1. What is it?
A status code indicating the user is not authenticated.

## 2. Why it matters?
It protects secure resources by requiring valid credentials.

## 3. How it works?
If a request lacks proper authentication (like token or login), the server responds with 401.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like trying to enter a club without showing your ID—you’re denied entry.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when a user needs to log in or provide a valid token.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Keeps endpoints secure ❌ Might confuse users if unclear error message is shown

## 7. Related Concepts
JWT, authentication middleware, login-required decorators

## 8. Conclusion
401 ensures only authenticated users can access protected content.

# ⚠️ HTTP 400 – Bad Request

## 1. What is it?
A status code meaning the server couldn’t understand the request due to invalid syntax or data.

## 2. Why it matters?
It helps catch client-side mistakes early (like missing form fields).

## 3. How it works?
If the client sends malformed JSON or invalid input, the server responds with 400.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like submitting a form without filling required fields—you get an error.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when request parameters are missing, invalid, or fail validation.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Helps with debugging and input validation ❌ Might be overused instead of more specific errors

## 7. Related Concepts
Validation, serializers, input sanitization

## 8. Conclusion
400 clearly tells the client: “You sent something wrong—fix it.”

# ✅ HTTP 201 – Created

## 1. What is it?
A status code meaning a new resource has been successfully created.

## 2. Why it matters?
Confirms successful creation actions like registration or posting data.

## 3. How it works?
After successfully creating a resource (like a user or blog), the server returns 201.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like getting a receipt after creating a new account—it confirms success.

## 5. When to use it?
Use after POST requests that result in new records in the database.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Provides clarity on success ❌ Needs consistency—don’t mix up with 200

## 7. Related Concepts
POST method, resource creation, REST standards

## 8. Conclusion
201 is a best practice response for successful resource creation.

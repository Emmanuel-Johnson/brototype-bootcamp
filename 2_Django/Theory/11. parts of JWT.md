# Parts of JWT

## 1. What is it?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit data between parties.

## 2. Why it matters?
It allows stateless authentication—no need to store sessions on the server.

## 3. How it works?
A JWT has 3 parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, separated by dots (`.`). The server signs it and the client sends it on each request.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a sealed envelope with a label (header), a message (payload), and a wax seal (signature).

## 5. When to use it?
Use for API authentication, single sign-on (SSO), or stateless session management.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Stateless, fast ❌ Can’t be revoked easily, risk if not encrypted or verified properly

## 7. Related Concepts
OAuth2, Access Token, Bearer Token, HMAC, RSA, JWT libraries (`PyJWT`, `rest_framework_simplejwt`)

## 8. Conclusion
Understanding the 3 parts of a JWT is key to using it safely and effectively in authentication systems.

# 🔍 JWT Structure

```
<HEADER>.<PAYLOAD>.<SIGNATURE>
```

## ✅ Header

JSON object with metadata about the token

**Example:**
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

## 🧾 Payload

Contains claims (user data or metadata)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "exp": 1723062677,
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

## 🔏 Signature

- Created by hashing header + payload with a secret key
- Ensures data integrity

**Example:**
```scss
HMACSHA256(base64url(header) + "." + base64url(payload), secret)
```

# Setting Status Code in Django

## 1. What is it?
It's the process of specifying the HTTP status code (like 200, 404, 403, 500) in your response to inform the client of the result.

## 2. Why it matters?
Proper status codes help clients (and browsers, APIs, etc.) understand the outcome of a request — success, failure, redirect, etc.

## 3. How it works?
You can pass `status=` to Django’s `HttpResponse`, `JsonResponse`, or shortcut methods like `render()` or `redirect()`.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like giving a delivery receipt: `200 OK` means delivered, `404 Not Found` means the address was wrong.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when returning custom errors, REST API responses, or to signal unauthorized access, redirection, etc.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Clear, standards-based communication ❌ Misuse can confuse clients or break API consumers

## 7. Related Concepts
`HttpResponse`, `JsonResponse`, `Http404`, `redirect`, Django REST Framework

## 8. Conclusion
Setting status codes in Django is crucial for building reliable web applications and APIs — it tells clients exactly what happened.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_page_view(request):
    context = {'message': 'Page not found'}
    return render(request, '404.html', context, status=404)
```

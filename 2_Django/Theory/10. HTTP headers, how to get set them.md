# HTTP Headers – How to Get/Set Them in Django

## 1. What is it?
HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between client and server to pass metadata (like content type, authorization, etc.).

## 2. Why it matters?
Headers control how requests/responses behave—important for security, caching, authentication, content negotiation, etc.

## 3. How it works?
Django reads request headers from `request.META` and allows you to set response headers using `response["Header-Name"] = "value"`.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a parcel label—it includes info like sender, recipient, and instructions without affecting the contents.

## 5. When to use it?
Use headers for things like tokens (`Authorization`), content format (`Content-Type`), or controlling browser behavior (`Cache-Control`).

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Flexible communication ❌ Easy to misuse or forget case-sensitivity

## 7. Related Concepts
`request.META`, `HttpResponse`, CORS, CSRF tokens, middleware

## 8. Conclusion
Mastering headers is key to secure and well-behaved web apps—they control how clients and servers talk “around” the data.

## ✅ How to Get Headers in Django

```python
def my_view(request):
    user_agent = request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT')  # standard header
    auth_header = request.META.get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION')  # e.g., Bearer token
    return HttpResponse(f"User-Agent: {user_agent}")
```
Note: All headers are prefixed with HTTP_, uppercased, and dashes replaced by underscores.

## ✅ How to Set Headers in Django

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def my_view(request):
    response = HttpResponse("OK")
    response["X-Custom-Header"] = "MyValue"
    response["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache"
    return response

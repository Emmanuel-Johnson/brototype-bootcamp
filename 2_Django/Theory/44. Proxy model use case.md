# Django Proxy Models

## 1. What is it?  
A proxy model in Django is a subclass of an existing model that doesn't add new fields but can change behavior (like ordering or methods).

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows you to customize behavior (e.g., admin views, model methods) without duplicating the database schema.

## 3. How it works?  
You define a new model class, set `proxy = True` in its Meta class, and override logic like model methods or default ordering.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like creating a different interface for the same data—same database table, different behavior.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use it when you want multiple views or admin interfaces of the same data model with different behavior or permissions.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Reuses existing schema, lightweight customization.  
❌ No new fields can be added.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Model inheritance, Admin customization, Custom managers.

## 8. Conclusion  
Proxy models offer a powerful way to extend model behavior or presentation without altering the database structure.

# Django Proxy Model Example

## Use Case: Creating a Staff User Proxy Model

This example demonstrates how to create a proxy model in Django to provide different admin views and permissions for the same underlying data.

### Code Implementation

```python
class User(AbstractUser):
    # standard user model
    pass

class StaffUser(User):
    class Meta:
        proxy = True
        ordering = ['-date_joined']
    
    def is_staff_user(self):
        return self.is_staff
```

### Benefits

- **Same Database Table**: Both `User` and `StaffUser` use the same database table
- **Different Admin Views**: You can create separate Django admin interfaces for each model
- **Custom Permissions**: Apply different permissions and filtering for staff users
- **Specialized Methods**: Add methods specific to staff user functionality
- **Custom Ordering**: Default ordering by most recent join date for staff users

### Usage

You can then create a custom Django admin for `StaffUser` with a different view or permissions from the default `User` admin, allowing you to:

- Filter and display only staff users
- Provide staff-specific actions and bulk operations
- Apply different field visibility and editing permissions
- Customize the admin interface specifically for staff management

# Django CSRF Protection

## 1. What is it?  
CSRF is a security threat where a malicious website tricks a user’s browser into submitting unwanted requests to a different site where the user is authenticated.

## 2. Why it matters?  
Without CSRF protection, attackers could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users (like changing passwords or making purchases).

## 3. How it works?  
Django uses a CSRF token — a unique value generated for each session — embedded in forms and validated on each POST request.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like using a one-time password (OTP) to verify a specific action so no one else can replay it.

## 5. When to use it?  
Always use it for any POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests, especially in authenticated forms or views.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Strong protection against CSRF attacks.  
❌ May break AJAX/JavaScript requests if not configured with the token properly.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Sessions, Cookies, CSRF token, `@csrf_protect`, `@csrf_exempt`, `csrf_token` template tag.

## 8. Conclusion  
Django’s built-in CSRF protection is essential for safeguarding forms and user actions from malicious cross-site attacks.

# What are Constraints in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
Constraints in Django are rules that enforce data integrity at the database level — preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being saved.

## 2. Why it matters?  
They help maintain correctness, uniqueness, and relationships in your database — even if something bypasses Django’s validations.

## 3. How it works?  
Django translates constraints (like `unique`, `check`, `foreign keys`) into SQL rules, which the database enforces automatically during insert or update.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like rules in a form — e.g., “email must be unique” or “price can’t be negative” — enforced directly by the system.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use constraints when you need guaranteed data integrity, especially in multi-user environments or when external systems access your DB.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Reliable, database-level safety.  
❌ Errors raise exceptions if not handled; some complex constraints may be DB-specific.

## 7. Related Concepts  
`unique`, `unique_together`, `CheckConstraint`, `ForeignKey`, `Meta.constraints`, Validation.

## 8. Conclusion  
Constraints are critical for protecting your data from corruption — Django makes it easy to define both simple and advanced rules directly in your models.

## 🔹 Practical Example

```python
from django.db import models

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.CheckConstraint(check=models.Q(age__gte=18), name='age_must_be_18_or_above'),
        ]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

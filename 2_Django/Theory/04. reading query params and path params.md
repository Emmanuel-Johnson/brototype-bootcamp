# Reading Query Parameters in Django

## 1. What is it?
Query parameters are the key-value pairs in a URL after the `?` symbol, used to send data via GET requests (e.g., `?page=2&search=shoes`).

## 2. Why it matters?
They're useful for filtering, pagination, sorting, and searching without altering the URL path.

## 3. How it works?
Django views can access them via `request.GET`, which behaves like a dictionary: `request.GET.get('key')`.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like ordering food by saying: "I want a pizza (`page=2`), but no cheese (`filter=cheese_free`)".

## 5. When to use it?
Use when you want to pass optional or dynamic data through URLs, such as in search filters or pagination.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Simple to use and shareable via URL. ‚ùå Data is exposed in the URL and limited in length.

## 7. Related Concepts
Path parameters (`<int:id>`), `request.POST` (for form data), `QueryDict`, URL routing.

## 8. Conclusion
Reading query parameters with `request.GET` is a clean way to handle dynamic URL inputs in Django views.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def product_list(request):
    page = request.GET.get('page')  # e.g., ?page=2
    search = request.GET.get('search')  # e.g., ?search=shoes
    # Use 'page' and 'search' for filtering or pagination
```

# Reading Path Parameters in Django

## 1. What is it?
Path parameters are parts of the URL path used to pass values like IDs or slugs to a view (e.g., `/product/42/`).

## 2. Why it matters?
They allow you to identify specific resources, like retrieving or editing a product by its ID or slug.

## 3. How it works?
You define them in `urls.py` (e.g., `path('product/<int:id>/', view)`) and Django passes them as arguments to the view function.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like using a locker number (e.g., `/locker/15/`) to find a specific item ‚Äî the number is part of the path.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when the data is required to fetch a specific resource, such as user profiles, articles, or products.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Clean, REST-friendly URLs. ‚ùå Less flexible than query params for optional filters.

## 7. Related Concepts
Query parameters (`request.GET`), URL dispatching, named URL patterns.

## 8. Conclusion
Path parameters are essential for accessing specific resources and are passed directly to your view from the URL pattern.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
# urls.py
path('product/<int:product_id>/', views.product_detail, name='product_detail')

# views.py
def product_detail(request, product_id):
    product = Product.objects.get(id=product_id)
    return render(request, 'product.html', {'product': product})
```

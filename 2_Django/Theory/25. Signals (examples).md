# What are Signals in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
A way for parts of your app to "listen" and react when something happens, like saving a model.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps your code stay organized — one part can react without being directly connected to the other.

## 3. How it works?  
You write a function (receiver) and tell Django to run it when an event (like saving a user) happens.

## 4. Example / Analogy  
Like an alarm: When a door opens (event), the alarm goes off (reaction), even though the door and alarm don’t talk to each other directly.

## 5. When to use it?  
When you want something automatic to happen — like sending a welcome email after a user signs up.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Keeps code separate and clean.  
❌ Can be tricky to follow if too many signals are used.

## 7. Related Concepts  
`post_save`, `pre_save`, `post_delete`, `receiver`, `dispatcher`.

## 8. Conclusion  
Signals let Django apps react to changes automatically — great for behind-the-scenes tasks like emails or logs.

# Django Signals Examples Guide

## ✅ 1. `post_save` — Send Welcome Email After User Registers

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def send_welcome_email(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        print(f"Welcome email sent to {instance.email}")
```

🔹 Triggered when a new user is created.

## ✏️ 2. `pre_save` — Capitalize Name Before Saving

```python
from django.db.models.signals import pre_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Customer

@receiver(pre_save, sender=Customer)
def capitalize_name(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.name = instance.name.capitalize()
```

🔹 Automatically capitalizes the customer's name before saving.

## 🧹 3. `post_delete` — Delete Image File When Product is Deleted

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_delete
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Product
import os

@receiver(post_delete, sender=Product)
def delete_product_image(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if instance.image1 and os.path.isfile(instance.image1.path):
        os.remove(instance.image1.path)
```

🔹 Cleans up product image file from disk after the product is deleted.

## 🔁 4. `post_save` — Create a Profile When User is Created

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Profile

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)
```

🔹 Automatically creates a `Profile` linked to the new user.

## 🧠 How to Use:

* Put these signal functions in a file like `signals.py` inside your app.
* Don't forget to **import them in** `apps.py` (so Django loads them):

```python
# apps.py
def ready(self):
    import yourapp.signals
```

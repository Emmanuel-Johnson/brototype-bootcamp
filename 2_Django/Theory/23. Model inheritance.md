# What is Model Inheritance in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
Model inheritance in Django allows you to define a base model and have other models inherit its fields and behavior.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps you follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by reusing common fields and logic across multiple models.

## 3. How it works?  
You define a parent model class, then subclass it in other models. Django supports **abstract models**, **multi-table inheritance**, and **proxy models**.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like having a “Vehicle” base class with common fields (speed, brand), and then subclasses like “Car” or “Bike” that inherit those fields.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use it when multiple models share common fields or behavior — like `created_at`, `updated_at`, or methods like `__str__()`.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Reduces code duplication, promotes reuse.  
❌ Can add complexity if not used carefully, especially with multi-table inheritance.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Abstract Base Class, Multi-table Inheritance, Proxy Models, `Meta` class.

## 8. Conclusion  
Model inheritance in Django is a clean and powerful way to reuse model logic and structure — use abstract models for shared fields, and multi-table inheritance when you need separate tables.

## 🔹 Practical Example 

In Django, **model inheritance** allows you to create a base model and then extend it in other models. This is useful when you want to reuse common fields or logic across multiple models. Django supports three types of model inheritance:

## 1. Abstract Base Classes ✅

Used when you want **to reuse fields** in multiple models, but **don't want a separate table** for the base model.

```python
from django.db import models

class CommonInfo(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class Student(CommonInfo):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    grade = models.CharField(max_length=10)

class Teacher(CommonInfo):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

🔹 `CommonInfo` won't create a DB table.  
🔹 `Student` and `Teacher` will have `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.

## 2. Multi-table Inheritance ✅

Used when you want each model (including the parent) to have its **own database table**, and Django creates a **OneToOneField** internally.

```python
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Student(Person):
    grade = models.CharField(max_length=10)
```

🔹 Two tables: `person` and `student`  
🔹 `student` has a OneToOne relationship to `person`  
🔹 Useful if you need to query parent and child objects separately

## 3. Proxy Models ✅

Used when you want to **change the behavior** (e.g., ordering or methods) of a model **without changing the schema**.

```python
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class StudentManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(name__startswith='S')

class StudentProxy(Person):
    objects = StudentManager()
    
    class Meta:
        proxy = True
```

🔹 No new table is created.  

🔹 Add custom managers (e.g., filter by status).

🔹 Add new Python methods.

🔹 Change default ordering.

🔹 Customize admin display.

## Summary Table 🧠

| Type | DB Table Created? | Use Case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Abstract Base Class | ❌ | Reuse common fields |
| Multi-table Inheritance | ✅ | Extend model and store data separately |
| Proxy Model | ❌ | Modify behavior without changing the schema |

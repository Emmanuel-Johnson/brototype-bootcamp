# Generic Views

## 1. What is it?  
Generic Views are pre-built class-based views provided by Django to handle common patterns like list, detail, create, update, and delete.

## 2. Why it matters?  
They help you write less code by handling repetitive logic, like rendering a list of objects or processing a form.

## 3. How it works?  
You inherit from generic classes like `ListView`, `DetailView`, or `CreateView`, and configure them with attributes like `model`, `template_name`, and `form_class`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like using a template in Word — you fill in a few details, and the structure is already set up for you.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use them when your views follow standard CRUD patterns — especially in admin panels or APIs.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Fast development, less boilerplate, DRY  
- ❌ Can feel "magical", harder to debug or customize deeply  

## 7. Related Concepts  
Related to Function-Based Views (FBVs), Class-Based Views (CBVs), Mixins, and Form classes.

## 8. Conclusion  
Generic views simplify Django development by abstracting common tasks — perfect when you want to move fast and follow best practices.

# What is a Primary Key in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
A Primary Key (PK) is a field (or combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a database table.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It ensures every row is uniquely identifiable — essential for data integrity and fast lookups.

## 3. How it works?  
In Django, each model automatically gets an `id` field as the primary key unless you define one explicitly using `primary_key=True`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a student roll number — no two students have the same one, and it's used to identify them.

## 5. When to use it?  
Always — every table must have one primary key, either default (`id`) or custom.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Ensures uniqueness, fast indexing.  
❌ Can’t have `NULL`, and only one PK per table is allowed.

## 7. Related Concepts  
`AutoField`, `primary_key=True`, `ForeignKey`, Indexes, Integrity Constraints.

## 8. Conclusion  
The primary key is the core unique identifier for a model — Django handles it automatically but allows customization when needed.

# What is a Unique Key in Django?

## 1. What is it?  
A Unique Key is a constraint that ensures no duplicate values are allowed in a specific field (or combination of fields) across rows.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps enforce business rules — like preventing duplicate emails or usernames in user tables.

## 3. How it works?  
In Django, you use `unique=True` on a model field, or define multiple-field uniqueness using `UniqueConstraint` in `Meta.constraints`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a license plate — it can’t be reused by another car, even if two people have the same name.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use when you want to prevent duplicates in fields like email, phone number, or custom identifiers.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Protects against duplication.  
❌ Can raise exceptions if not handled properly; can allow `NULL`s (depends on DB).

## 7. Related Concepts  
`unique=True`, `UniqueConstraint`, `unique_together`, `validate_unique()`.

## 8. Conclusion  
Unique keys are used to enforce business-level uniqueness — unlike primary keys, you can have multiple unique fields per table.

# Python @staticmethod Overview

## 1. What is it?
`@staticmethod` is a Python decorator that defines a method inside a class that doesn‚Äôt access the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`).

## 2. Why it matters?
It allows grouping utility functions inside a class for better organization, without depending on object state.

## 3. How it works?
When a method is marked `@staticmethod`, it can be called using `ClassName.method()` or `instance.method()` without needing instance or class context.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a calculator function (e.g., `add(a, b)`) placed inside a class for logical grouping, but it doesn't need any internal class data.

## 5. When to use it?
When the method performs a task related to the class but doesn‚Äôt need to access or modify instance/class attributes.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Clear structure, logical grouping  
‚ùå No access to `self` or `cls`, so limited use cases inside models/views

## 7. Related Concepts
`@classmethod`, instance methods, utility functions, model helpers

## 8. Conclusion
`@staticmethod` is useful for including stateless helper functions within Django classes like models or views, promoting cleaner code structure.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
class ProductUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
        return price - (price * discount_percent / 100)

# Using it without creating an instance:
final_price = ProductUtils.calculate_discount(1000, 20)
print(final_price)  # Output: 800.0
```

## üîç Where This Is Useful in Django

In a Django model or view where you want to group a helper function logically, but **it doesn't depend on instance data**.

### Example in Django Model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.FloatField()
    
    @staticmethod
    def apply_tax(price, tax_rate):
        return price + (price * tax_rate)

# Usage:
final_price = Product.apply_tax(500, 0.18)
```

## Key Benefits of Static Methods

- **No instance required**: Can be called directly on the class
- **Logical grouping**: Keeps related utility functions within the appropriate class
- **Memory efficient**: Doesn't create unnecessary instance variables
- **Clear intent**: Signals that the method doesn't depend on instance state

# Python @classmethod Overview

## 1. What is it?
`@classmethod` is a decorator that defines a method which receives the class itself (`cls`) as the first argument, instead of the instance (`self`).

## 2. Why it matters?
It lets you create utility methods that operate on the class level ‚Äî useful for creating objects or querying with custom logic.

## 3. How it works?
The method can access or modify class-level data, and it's commonly used to define custom model constructors or managers.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a factory that builds model instances in a specific way, based on given rules, without needing an existing object.

## 5. When to use it?
When you need to define alternate constructors (e.g., `create_with_defaults()`) or logic that works with the model class itself.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Powerful for factory patterns, reusability  
‚ùå Cannot access instance-level data (`self`) directly

## 7. Related Concepts
`@staticmethod`, `self` vs `cls`, model managers, factory methods

## 8. Conclusion
`@classmethod` is a great way to encapsulate model-level logic in Django ‚Äî often used for custom object creation or class-wide utilities.

---

## üîπ Practical Example

Here's a **simple practical example** of `@classmethod` in Django, especially useful when you want a custom way to create model instances ‚Äî like a factory method:

## üß™ Scenario
You have a `Product` model and want to create products with default price if not given.

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
    
    @classmethod
    def create_with_default_price(cls, name):
        default_price = 99.99
        return cls.objects.create(name=name, price=default_price)
```

## ‚úÖ Usage

```python
# Somewhere in your view or shell
new_product = Product.create_with_default_price("Basic T-Shirt")
print(new_product.name)  # Basic T-Shirt
print(new_product.price)  # 99.99
```

## üîç Why this is useful:
* You don't need to remember the default logic in multiple places.
* Makes your code cleaner by encapsulating the rule.
* Easy to update later ‚Äî change one method instead of many usages.

## Django Class Method Example: Product Discount System

Here's another **@classmethod** example ‚Äî this time showing how to **change a class-level value or apply logic involving class-level configuration**.

## üß™ Example: Applying a Discount to All Products Using a Class Method

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
    
    # Class variable (shared among all instances)
    discount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount
    
    @classmethod
    def set_discount_rate(cls, new_rate):
        cls.discount_rate = new_rate
    
    def get_discounted_price(self):
        return self.price * (1 - self.discount_rate)
```

## ‚úÖ Usage:

```python
# Set discount rate globally for all products
Product.set_discount_rate(0.20)

# Create a product
p = Product.objects.create(name="Sneakers", price=150)

# Get discounted price
print(p.get_discounted_price())  # 120.0 (20% discount)
```

## üîç Why This is Useful:

* You can **change shared configuration** (like discount rates) for the whole class.
* Keeps logic **centralized and maintainable**.
* Can be combined with admin tools or environment-specific configs.

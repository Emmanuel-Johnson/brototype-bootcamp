# Gunicorn Overview

## 1. What is it?
Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a Python WSGI HTTP server used to serve Python web apps like Django in production.

## 2. Why it matters?
Django’s built-in server is for development only — Gunicorn efficiently handles multiple requests in production environments.

## 3. How it works?
It runs your Django app as a WSGI application with multiple worker processes to handle web traffic concurrently.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of Django as a chef and Gunicorn as the waiter delivering requests and responses between the customer (browser) and the chef (app).

## 5. When to use it?
Always use Gunicorn (or similar WSGI servers) when deploying Django apps to production.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ Fast, simple to configure, widely supported  
❌ Needs to be used behind a reverse proxy like Nginx for robustness and security

## 7. Related Concepts

# Join table (via ORM relations: FK, M2M) 

## 1. **ForeignKey (One-to-Many)**

### Relation:
Each item in the model points to one item in another model (child â†’ parent), but the parent can have many children.

### Code Example:
```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

### Behind the scenes:
Django creates a **JOIN** between `Book` and `Author` using the `author_id` column in the `Book` table.

### Usage:
```python
books = Book.objects.select_related('author')
# Single query with JOIN: Book.author_id = Author.id
```

### Access:
```python
for book in books:
    print(f"Book: {book.title}, Author: {book.author.name}")
```

## 2. **ManyToManyField (M2M)**

### Relation:
Each item in one model can relate to many in another, and vice versa.

### Code Example:
```python
class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Course(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    students = models.ManyToManyField(Student)
```

### Behind the scenes:
Django creates a **third join table** automatically named like `appname_course_students` with:
- `student_id`
- `course_id`

### Usage:
```python
courses = Course.objects.prefetch_related('students')
# Two separate queries: one for courses, one for all related students
```

### Access:
```python
for course in courses:
    for student in course.students.all():
        print(f"Course: {course.title}, Student: {student.name}")
```

# ✅ Validators in Django

## Section | Answer

### 1. What is it?  
Validators are functions or classes used to check if a field's value meets certain rules or constraints.

### 2. Why it matters?  
They help ensure data integrity and prevent invalid or harmful input from being saved to the database.

### 3. How it works?  
You attach a validator to a model or form field, and Django will automatically call it during validation (e.g., before saving).

### 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a security guard checking if you’re following the rules before letting you into a system.

### 5. When to use it?  
Use when you need custom rules beyond built-in field options — like checking a username doesn’t contain "admin".

### 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Reusable, testable, and cleanly separates logic  
- ❌ Can add complexity if overused or badly organized  

### 7. Related Concepts  
Related to Forms, ModelForms, Field options, Clean methods, and Serializers in DRF.

### 8. Conclusion  
Validators provide a clean way to enforce business rules and maintain data quality across your Django app.

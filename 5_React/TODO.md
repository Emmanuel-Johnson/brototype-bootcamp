Do pratical task using useReducer and all other hooks that you have learned
Action Creator
useSelector and useDispatch
createAsyncThunk function
combineReducers 
CSR vs SSR
Detructuring
Dynamic Rendering
Action Creator
combined reducers
useref ,usememo,reducer
callback
use callback hook
action vs action creator
Redux middle wears
(workout) - using useeffect api data fetching.
Theory:-
How do you update state in a class component?
What are action creators?
How can we handle async actions in Redux?
What is the use of the Immer library?
Practical:-
Create a component to fetch data from an API –  Not done
CSR vs SSR
Destructuring
Dynamic rendering exact concept
useRef
why ssr fatser for initial loading
destructuring
dynamic rendering
useEffect exact conept
React.memo() concept
use Reducer
Action vs Action creator
redux toolkit
Pure Component

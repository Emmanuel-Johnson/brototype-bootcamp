# Django Sessions

## 1. What is it?
A session in Django is a way to store data specific to a particular user between requests â€” without needing to use cookies directly or expose data to the client.

Think of it as temporary backend storage for a user â€” such as their login status, cart items, preferences, etc.

## 2. Why it matters
- HTTP is stateless; Django sessions bring state to web apps.
- Enables personalized user experiences.
- Crucial for authentication, shopping carts, dashboards, and more.

## 3. How Django Session Works
**Behind-the-scenes flow:**
1. When a user first visits, Django creates a session and generates a unique `sessionid`.
2. This `sessionid` is stored in the userâ€™s browser cookie.
3. All actual session data is stored on the server (DB, cache, or file-based).
4. On each request, Django reads the cookie, finds session data, and provides it to your app.
5. You can read/write data using `request.session`.

## 4. Where is session data stored?
Django supports multiple backends:

| Backend Type      | Setting                                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Database (default)| `django.contrib.sessions.backends.db`           |
| File-based        | `django.contrib.sessions.backends.file`         |
| Cached            | `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache`        |
| Cache + DB        | `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db`    |
| Encrypted Cookie  | `django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies`|

**Configured in `settings.py`:**
```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'
```

## 5. Basic Usage Example
```python
# Store data in session
request.session['username'] = 'emmanuel'

# Get data from session
name = request.session.get('username', 'Guest')

# Delete session key
del request.session['username']

# Clear entire session
request.session.flush()
```

## 6. Session Settings to Know
- `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`: Default is 2 weeks (in seconds)
- `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`: If True, session ends when browser closes
- `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST`: Save session to DB on every request

### ðŸ§  Interview Explanation

In Django, sessions provide a way to store per-user data across requests without storing everything in cookies. When a session is created, Django generates a unique session ID and stores it in the userâ€™s browser as a cookie, while the actual session data is stored server-side â€” by default in the database. This allows you to store and retrieve data using `request.session`, making it ideal for features like login states, shopping carts, or tracking preferences. Django supports multiple session backends including database, file-based, cache, and signed cookies. Sessions are essential in building dynamic, personalized web applications and play a critical role in authentication workflows.

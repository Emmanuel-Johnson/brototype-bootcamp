# ORM 

## What
ORM stands for **Object-Relational Mapping**. It's a layer that lets you work with your database using **Python classes and objects** instead of raw SQL queries.

## Why
- You write **Python code** to interact with the database, no SQL needed
- It makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more secure (less risk of SQL injection)
- It abstracts away database differences â€” you can switch databases without rewriting queries

## How
In Django, your models (Python classes) represent database tables. Django ORM converts your Python code into SQL behind the scenes.

## Example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2)

# Create a product (INSERT)
product = Product.objects.create(name='Laptop', price=999.99)

# Read products (SELECT)
all_products = Product.objects.all()

# Update a product
product.price = 899.99
product.save()

# Delete a product
product.delete()
```

## Benefits:
- Easy to perform CRUD operations
- Supports complex queries, filters, joins, aggregations using Python methods
- Integrates smoothly with Django forms and admin

ORM is like your **translator** between Python and SQL, making database work simple and pythonic.

## ðŸ§  Interview Explanation

Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) lets you interact with your database using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries, making your code cleaner, more secure, and easier to maintain. It abstracts away database-specific details so you can switch databases without rewriting your queries. In Django, models represent database tables, and the ORM translates your Python code into SQL behind the scenes. You can perform all CRUD operations effortlesslyâ€”creating, reading, updating, and deleting recordsâ€”with intuitive Python methods like .create(), .all(), .save(), and .delete(). Beyond basics, Django ORM supports complex filters, joins, and aggregations, and integrates seamlessly with Django forms and the admin panel. Essentially, itâ€™s your powerful Python-to-SQL translator, simplifying database management in a pythonic way.

# URL Routing

## 1. What is it?

URL routing in Django is the process of mapping a URL entered by a user (like `/products/5/`) to the corresponding view function that handles the request.

> **Analogy:**  
> User types a URL → Django checks your `urls.py` → Sends them to the right view.

---

## 2. Why it matters?

- **Navigation:** Without routing, your site can’t respond to different pages.
- **Maintainability:** Keeps URLs organized and easy to change.
- **Dynamic content:** Allows URLs with variables (e.g., `/products/5/`).
- **Clean structure:** Helps build SEO-friendly and human-readable URLs.

---

## 3. How it works

1. Django starts at the root `urls.py` (usually in your project folder).
2. It goes through the list of URL patterns (`urlpatterns`) top to bottom.
3. When it finds the first matching pattern, it calls the linked view function.
4. If no pattern matches, Django shows a 404 page.

## 4. Core Syntax Example

**project/urls.py**
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),       # Django admin
    path('shop/', include('shop.urls')),   # routes to shop app
]
```

**shop/urls.py**
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.shop_home, name='shop_home'),            # /shop/
    path('product/<int:product_id>/', views.product_detail, name='product_detail'),  # /shop/product/5/
]
```

**shop/views.py**
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def shop_home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to the Shop!")

def product_detail(request, product_id):
    return HttpResponse(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
```

## 5. Types of URL Parameters

| Type    | Example                        | Use Case                       |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Static  | `/about/`                     | Fixed pages like About Us      |
| Dynamic | `/product/<int:id>/`          | Show a specific product        |
| Slug    | `/blog/<slug:post_slug>/`     | SEO-friendly blog links        |
| String  | `/user/<str:username>/`       | Profiles with usernames        |

## 6. Example / Analogy

Think of URL routing like a receptionist in an office:

1. Visitor walks in (HTTP request).
2. Receptionist looks at their request (the URL).
3. Directs them to the right department (view function).
4. If no department matches → “Sorry, we don’t have that” (404 error).

## 7. Use Cases

- **E-commerce:** `/products/`, `/cart/`, `/checkout/`
- **Job Portal:** `/jobs/`, `/jobs/<id>/apply/`
- **Admin Panel:** `/admin/dashboard/`, `/admin/users/`

---

## 8. Pros and Cons

**✅ Pros**
- Clean, human-readable URLs
- Flexible (supports static & dynamic routes)
- Allows modular apps with `include()`
- SEO-friendly with slugs

**❌ Cons**
- Too many nested includes can get messy
- Complex dynamic patterns need careful regex handling (before path converters existed)

---

## 9. Related Concepts

- **Path Converters:** (`<int:id>`, `<slug:slug>`)
- **Reverse URL resolution:** (`reverse` or `{% url %}` in templates)
- **Named URLs:** avoids hardcoding paths
- **Middleware:** can process requests before they hit the view

---

## 10. Conclusion

Django’s URL routing is the traffic controller of your web app. It ensures every request lands in the right place. By structuring your URLs well and using path converters, you can make your site more maintainable, SEO-friendly, and user-focused.

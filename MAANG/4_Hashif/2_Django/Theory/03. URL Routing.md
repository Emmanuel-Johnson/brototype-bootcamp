# URL Routing in Django

## 1. What is URL Routing?
URL Routing in Django maps incoming HTTP requests (URLs) to the correct view function or class, which processes the logic and returns a response.

**Flow:**  
`Request URL â†’ URLconf (URL configuration) â†’ View function/class`

## 2. Why is URL Routing Important?
- Connects browser requests to server-side Python logic.
- Provides structure and flow to your app.
- Every page, API endpoint, or action uses routing.

## 3. How URL Routing Works
1. Django checks `project/urls.py`.
2. Matches the requested URL path with a `path()` or `re_path()` pattern.
3. If matched, calls the linked view function.
4. If no match, returns a 404 error.

## 4. Core Syntax

```python
# project/urls.py or app/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('home/', views.home, name='home'),
    path('products/<int:id>/', views.product_detail, name='product_detail'),
]
```
- `path()` is for clean URL patterns.
- `re_path()` is for regex-based patterns.

## 5. Types of Routes

| Type      | Example                          | Description              |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Static    | `path('about/', ...)`            | Fixed URL                |
| Dynamic   | `path('product/<int:id>/', ...)` | Accepts variable values  |
| Nested    | `include('app.urls')`            | Included from other apps |
| Regex     | `re_path(r'^products/$', ...)`   | Complex pattern matching |

## 6. The `include()` Function
Used to split URLs per app for scalability:

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
]
```
All URLs in `accounts/urls.py` are prefixed with `/accounts/`.

## 7. Naming Your URLs (Best Practice)
Helps with reverse resolution and HTML hrefs:

```python
# urls.py
path('login/', views.login_view, name='login')

# template
<a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login</a>
```

## ðŸ§  Interview Explanation

In Django, URL routing directs incoming requests to the appropriate view function or class. Defined in `urlpatterns` (usually in `urls.py`), each pattern maps to a specific view. Static and dynamic routes use `path()`, while `re_path()` supports regex for complex matching. Django checks each pattern in order and calls the first matching view. The `include()` function modularizes URLs across apps. Naming URLs enables reverse lookups in templates and redirects. This routing system is central to request handling in any Django app.

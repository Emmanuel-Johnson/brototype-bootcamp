## 1. What is it?
A **list comprehension** is a compact and readable way to create lists in Python. Instead of writing multiple lines with a `for` loop, you can generate lists in a single line using an expression inside brackets.

## 2. Why it matters
- Makes code cleaner and shorter.
- Improves readability for simple transformations.
- Usually faster than using traditional loops with `append()`.
- Widely used in real projects, so interviewers expect you to know it.

## 3. How it works

**Basic syntax:**
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```
- `expression`: what to put in the new list
- `item`: variable from the iterable
- `iterable`: source sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.)
- `if condition` (optional): filter items

**Examples:**
```python
# 1. Simple transformation
squares = [x**2 for x in range(6)]
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# 2. With condition
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# 3. Nested (flattening a 2D list)
matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

## 4. When to use it
- When you want a new list from an iterable.
- When you need filtering and transformation in one step.
- For short, clear logic (avoid if it becomes too complex).
- For nested loops when flattening or combining data.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Concise, reduces boilerplate.
- ✅ Faster than regular loops in many cases.
- ✅ Improves readability for straightforward tasks.

**Cons:**
- ❌ Readability suffers if logic is too complex.
- ❌ Harder to debug than traditional loops.
- ❌ Not suitable for multi-step or complicated logic (better use a normal loop).

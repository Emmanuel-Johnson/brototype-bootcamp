## 1. What is it?
A **list comprehension** is a compact and readable way to create lists in Python. Instead of writing multiple lines with a `for` loop, you can generate lists in a single line using an expression inside brackets.

## 2. Why it matters
- Makes code cleaner and shorter.
- Improves readability for simple transformations.
- Usually faster than using traditional loops with `append()`.
- Widely used in real projects, so interviewers expect you to know it.

## 3. How it works

**Basic syntax:**
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```
- `expression`: what to put in the new list
- `item`: variable from the iterable
- `iterable`: source sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.)
- `if condition` (optional): filter items

**Examples:**
```python
# 1. Simple transformation
squares = [x**2 for x in range(6)]
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# 2. With condition
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# 3. Nested (flattening a 2D list)
matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

## 4. When to use it
- When you want a new list from an iterable.
- When you need filtering and transformation in one step.
- For short, clear logic (avoid if it becomes too complex).
- For nested loops when flattening or combining data.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Concise, reduces boilerplate.
- ✅ Faster than regular loops in many cases.
- ✅ Improves readability for straightforward tasks.

**Cons:**
- ❌ Readability suffers if logic is too complex.
- ❌ Harder to debug than traditional loops.
- ❌ Not suitable for multi-step or complicated logic (better use a normal loop).

## 🧠 Interview Explanation

List comprehension in Python is a concise and readable way to create new lists by transforming or filtering existing iterables — all in a single line. The syntax follows the pattern [expression for item in iterable if condition], where the condition is optional. It’s widely used in real-world projects because it reduces boilerplate and often runs faster than traditional for loops with append(). List comprehensions are perfect when you need to generate a list from another sequence, especially for simple transformations or filtering tasks. They’re also great for flattening nested structures. However, if the logic gets too complex or involves multiple steps, it’s better to stick with regular loops to maintain readability and make debugging easier.

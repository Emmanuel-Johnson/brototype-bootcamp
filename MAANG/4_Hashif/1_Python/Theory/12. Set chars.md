# ✅ Key Characteristics of a Python Set

## Unordered
There is no guaranteed order of elements in a set.

```python
s = {3, 1, 2}
print(s)   # {1, 2, 3} or some other order
```

## No Duplicates
Sets automatically remove duplicate elements.

```python
s = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print(s)   # {1, 2, 3}
```

## Mutable
You can add or remove items after creation.

```python
s = {1, 2}
s.add(3)
print(s)  # {1, 2, 3}
```

## Heterogeneous Elements (Must Be Hashable)
Sets can contain mixed data types, but all elements must be immutable (hashable).

```python
s = {1, "hello", (2, 3)}
print(s)
# s.add([4,5])  # ❌ error: list is mutable (unhashable)
```

## No Indexing / Slicing
Unlike lists or tuples, you can’t access set elements by index.

```python
s = {10, 20, 30}
# print(s[0])  # ❌ TypeError
```

## Fast Membership Testing
Sets use a hash table internally, providing O(1) average time for membership checks.

```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
print(2 in s)  # True
```

## Supports Set Operations
Sets support union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

```python
a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {2, 3, 4}
print(a | b)  # {1, 2, 3, 4} union
print(a & b)  # {2, 3} intersection
print(a - b)  # {1} difference
```

⚡ **Interview Tip:**  
“In Python, sets are unordered collections of unique, hashable elements. They don’t allow duplicates, don’t support indexing, and are optimized for fast membership testing. Sets are mutable, support typical set operations like union and intersection, and require elements to be immutable types.”

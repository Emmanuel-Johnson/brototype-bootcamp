## üü¶ Shallow Copy

### 1. What is it?
A **shallow copy** creates a new outer object, but its nested objects are references to the originals.  
**Effect:** Changes inside nested lists/dicts affect both copies.

> **Analogy:** New backpack, but you put the same books inside.

### 2. Why it matters
- Saves memory (reuses nested objects).
- **Risk:** If nested data changes, both original and copy are updated.

### 3. How it works (Python)
```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow = copy.copy(original)

original[0][0] = 99
print(shallow)  # [[99, 2], [3, 4]]
```
- Outer list is new.
- Inner lists are still linked.

### 4. When to use
- When nested objects won‚Äôt change.
- For read‚Äëonly data or configs.
- When performance/memory efficiency is more important than independence.

### 5. Pros & Cons
**‚úÖ Pros**
- Faster and lightweight.
- Good for immutable or static data.

**‚ùå Cons**
- Risky with mutable nested objects (side effects).

## üü• Deep Copy

### 1. What is it?
A **deep copy** creates a completely new object, recursively copying everything inside, including nested objects.  
**Effect:** The copy is 100% independent.

> **Analogy:** New backpack, and you photocopy every book too.

### 2. Why it matters
- Ensures changes in one don‚Äôt affect the other.
- Safer for complex mutable structures (lists of dicts, trees, etc.).

### 3. How it works (Python)
```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

original[0][0] = 99
print(deep)  # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
- Outer + inner lists are fully independent.

### 4. When to use
- When you need true independence.
- Use cases: game states, undo/redo stacks, data snapshots.

### 5. Pros & Cons
**‚úÖ Pros**
- Full data isolation.
- Safe with complex mutable data.

**‚ùå Cons**
- Slower and more memory‚Äëheavy.
- Can fail on objects that can‚Äôt be deep‚Äëcopied (e.g., file handles).

## ‚ö° Bottom Line for Interviews

- **Shallow copy:** Shares nested objects (fast but risky).
- **Deep copy:** Duplicates everything (safe but costly).

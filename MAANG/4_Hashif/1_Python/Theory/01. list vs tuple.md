# List 

## 1. What is it?
A list in Python is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. You can store numbers, strings, objects, or even other lists inside it.

## 2. Why it matters?
Lists are one of the most common data structures in Python — you’ll use them constantly for grouping, iterating, and manipulating data.

## 3. How it works?
- Declared using square brackets `[]`.  
- Items are separated by commas.  
- Supports indexing (`list[0]`), slicing (`list[1:3]`), and methods like `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.sort()`.  
- Under the hood, Python lists are **dynamic arrays**, meaning they resize automatically when you add or remove elements.

## 4. When to use it?
Use lists when you need:
- To maintain order of elements.  
- To allow duplicates.  
- To frequently add/remove or iterate over items.  

⚡ If order doesn’t matter, a **set** may be better.  
⚡ If keys and values are needed, use a **dict**.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros**  
- ✅ Flexible — can hold mixed data types.  
- ✅ Easy to modify and iterate.  
- ✅ Supports slicing, nesting, and built-in methods.  

**Cons**  
- ❌ Slower lookups compared to sets/dicts.  
- ❌ Consumes more memory for very large datasets compared to arrays in lower-level languages.

# Tuple 

## 1. What is it?
A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items in Python. Once created, you can’t add, remove, or change elements.

## 2. Why it matters?
Tuples are useful when you need a fixed set of values that shouldn’t accidentally change — making your code safer and often faster.

## 3. How it works?
- Declared using parentheses `()`, or just by separating items with commas.
- Supports indexing (`tuple[0]`) and slicing (`tuple[1:3]`).
- Can hold mixed data types, including other tuples.
- Because they’re immutable, Python can optimize memory and speed when using tuples compared to lists.

```python
# Example
point = (3, 4)
print(point[0])  # 3

# Tuple without parentheses
colors = "red", "blue", "green"
print(colors)  # ('red', 'blue', 'green')
```

## 4. When to use it?
Use a tuple when:
- Data should not change (e.g., days of the week, coordinates, database keys).
- You want a hashable collection to use as a dictionary key or in a set.
- You need slightly better performance than a list for fixed data.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros**  
- ✅ Immutable → safer, prevents accidental changes.  
- ✅ Slightly faster and lighter than lists.  
- ✅ Can be used as dict keys (lists can’t).  

**Cons**  
- ❌ Can’t modify after creation (less flexible).  
- ❌ Fewer built‑in methods compared to lists.

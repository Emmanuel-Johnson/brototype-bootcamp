# üü¶ @property 

## 1. What is it?

`@property` is a built‚Äëin decorator in Python that lets you turn a method into a read‚Äëonly attribute.

- You write methods but use them like attributes.
- Allows you to control access to class data without changing the public API.

---

## 2. Why it matters

- Provides encapsulation (hides internal logic but exposes a clean interface).
- Lets you add logic (validation, computation, caching) without breaking existing code.
- Used heavily in frameworks (Django, SQLAlchemy, etc.) for computed fields.

---

## 3. How it works

### Example 1: Simple @property

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius  # underscore signals "private"

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self._radius ** 2

c = Circle(5)
print(c.area)  # looks like an attribute, but calls the method
```

Here, `.area` is calculated on demand. No parentheses required.

---

### Example 2: Using Getter + Setter

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):       # getter
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):  # setter
        if not value.strip():
            raise ValueError("Name cannot be empty")
        self._name = value

p = Person("Alice")
print(p.name)     # uses getter
p.name = "Bob"    # uses setter
```

---

### Example 3: Read‚ÄëOnly Property

If you don‚Äôt define a setter, the property is read-only:

```python
class Config:
    @property
    def version(self):
        return "1.0.0"

cfg = Config()
print(cfg.version)   # 1.0.0
# cfg.version = "2.0.0" -> AttributeError
```

---

## 4. When to use it

- When you want computed attributes.
- When you need to add validation to a field later without breaking old code.
- When exposing read‚Äëonly properties.
- To keep your API clean and Pythonic (`obj.area` instead of `obj.get_area()`).

---

## 5. Pros & Cons

**‚úÖ Pros**
- Clean, attribute‚Äëstyle access.
- Supports validation with setters.
- Backward‚Äëcompatible (you can upgrade a field into a property later).

**‚ùå Cons**
- Can hide expensive calculations (looks like a field but may be costly).
- Too many properties can make code harder to read/maintain.

---

## ‚ö° Bottom Line

Use `@property` when you want methods to look like attributes but still give you the flexibility of getters/setters. It‚Äôs one of the most Pythonic ways to keep code clean and safe.

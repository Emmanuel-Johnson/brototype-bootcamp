## 1. What is it?
A lambda function is a small, anonymous function in Python — created using the `lambda` keyword instead of `def`.

**Syntax:**  
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
- Can take any number of arguments but only one expression.

## 2. Why it matters
Lambda functions let you write quick, throwaway functions without formally defining them. Perfect for situations where you don’t want the overhead of `def`.

## 3. How it works
- You define it inline using `lambda`.
- It automatically returns the evaluated expression (no `return` keyword).
- Commonly used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`, and `reduce()`.

```python
# Example
square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))  # 25
```

## 4. When to use it
Use lambda when:
- You need a short, one‑line function.
- Passing a function as an argument (`map`, `filter`, `sorted`).
- You don’t plan to reuse the function elsewhere.

**Don’t use it for complex logic — use `def` instead for readability.**

## 5. Pros and Cons
**Pros**
- ✅ Concise — saves lines of code.
- ✅ Great for functional programming tasks.

**Cons**
- ❌ Limited — only one expression, no statements.
- ❌ Can hurt readability if overused.

## 🧠 Interview Explanation

A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, single-expression function defined using the lambda keyword instead of def. It’s used to create quick, throwaway functions, especially when you need a function for a short time and don’t want to formally define one. The syntax is simple: lambda arguments: expression, and it automatically returns the result of the expression. Lambda functions are commonly used with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), sorted(), and reduce() where you pass logic as an argument. They’re best suited for short, simple tasks — like sorting a list of tuples or applying a quick transformation. However, they’re limited to a single expression and can reduce code readability if overused, so for anything complex, it’s better to go with a regular def function.

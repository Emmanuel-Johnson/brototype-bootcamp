# Decorators 

## 1. What is a Decorator?
A decorator in Python is a function that modifies or enhances another function or method without changing its actual code.  
It acts as a wrapper around a function and is implemented using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

## 2. Why Decorators Matter
- Add reusable functionality (logging, authentication, caching) without rewriting code.
- Core feature in frameworks like Django and Flask (e.g., `@login_required`).
- Improves code reusability, readability, and supports the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.

## 3. How Decorators Work

**Basic structure:**
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before the function runs")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After the function runs")
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

**Output:**
```
Before the function runs  
Hello!  
After the function runs  
```

- `@decorator` is shorthand for `say_hello = decorator(say_hello)`
- The wrapper function adds new behavior before/after the original function.

## 4. When to Use Decorators
- **Authentication:** `@login_required` in Django.
- **Logging/Debugging:** Log when functions are called.
- **Access Control:** Restrict certain users.
- **Memoization/Caching:** Store results to speed up repeated calls.
- **Validation:** Check arguments before execution.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros**
- ✅ Keeps code clean and DRY.
- ✅ Adds functionality without touching original code.
- ✅ Highly reusable and composable.

**Cons**
- ❌ Can make code harder to debug if overused.
- ❌ Beginners may find the flow confusing (functions returning functions).
- ❌ Improper use can hide side effects.

### 🔑 One‑liner for Interview
> “A decorator is a function in Python that wraps another function to extend or modify its behavior, commonly used for logging, authentication, and access control. They’re powerful for writing clean, reusable code, especially in frameworks like Django and Flask.”

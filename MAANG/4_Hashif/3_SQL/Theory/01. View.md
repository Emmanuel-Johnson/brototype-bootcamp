## 1. What is a View?

A **View** in PostgreSQL is a virtual table representing the result of a stored SQL `SELECT` query. It doesn‚Äôt hold data itself ‚Äî instead, it dynamically displays data pulled from one or more base tables when queried.

## 2. Why Do Views Matter?

Views:
- **Simplify complex queries** by abstracting logic.
- **Improve code reusability** across your database.
- **Enhance security** by exposing only necessary data.
- **Centralize logic** for easier maintenance in large systems.

### Why Use Views?

- **Abstraction Layer:** Hide complex queries behind a simple name.
- **Security:** Restrict direct access to actual tables.
- **Reusability:** Use the same logic in multiple places.
- **Maintainability:** Update logic in one place.
- **Readability:** Break down complex queries into manageable components.

## 3. How Do Views Work?

- Created using `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...`
- Queried just like a real table: `SELECT * FROM view_name`
- Always show live, up-to-date data from base tables.
- Not always updatable (only simple views can be updated).
- For static snapshots, use **materialized views**.

### Example

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE is_active = true;
```

## 4. When to Use Views

Use views when you need to:
- Abstract and reuse complex SQL logic.
- Expose only a portion of data (for permissions/security).
- Join multiple tables and present combined data.
- Build read-only dashboards, reports, or analytics layers.
- Organize messy, repeated queries into a clean interface.

> ‚ö° **Use materialized views** for performance-heavy, read-mostly scenarios.  
> ‚ö° **Avoid views** if you need heavy updates ‚Äî not always supported.

## 5. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Simplifies complex logic.
- Enhances security by hiding sensitive columns.
- Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Easy to use for analytics/reporting layers.

### ‚ùå Cons
- Not always updatable.
- Slight performance hit if used excessively on large joins.
- No indexes directly on views (except materialized views).
- Debugging can be tricky with many layered views.

## üß† Interview Explanation

In PostgreSQL, a View is a virtual table that represents the result of a stored SQL query. It doesn‚Äôt store data physically but displays live data pulled from one or more base tables. Views are defined using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, and they simplify complex queries by abstracting logic into a reusable object. They support `SELECT` operations just like real tables, and can be used to enhance security by exposing only specific columns or rows to users. Views can be updated if based on a single simple table without aggregates or joins. For performance-heavy tasks, PostgreSQL also supports materialized views which cache the data. Overall, views are essential for clean, maintainable, and secure database design, especially in large or modular systems.

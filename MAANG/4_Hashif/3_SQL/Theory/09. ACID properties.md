# ACID Properties 

## A — Atomicity
**What:** All steps in a transaction happen completely or not at all.  
**Why:** To avoid partial changes that mess up your data.  
**How:** If any step fails, PostgreSQL rolls back the whole transaction — nothing is saved. Example: Money transfer either debits *and* credits or does nothing.

## C — Consistency
**What:** Database moves from one valid state to another.  
**Why:** To keep data rules, constraints, and relationships intact.  
**How:** PostgreSQL enforces constraints (like foreign keys, unique keys) during transactions. If a transaction breaks a rule, it won't commit.

## I — Isolation
**What:** Transactions don't interfere with each other.  
**Why:** To prevent dirty reads, lost updates, and other concurrency bugs.  
**How:** PostgreSQL uses **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** and offers isolation levels like:
- **Read Committed** (default)
- **Repeatable Read**
- **Serializable** (strictest)

You choose based on your consistency vs. performance needs.

## D — Durability
**What:** Once committed, changes survive crashes or power loss.  
**Why:** To ensure no data is lost after commit.  
**How:** PostgreSQL uses **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**, writing changes to disk before confirming commit.

## Quick Recap Table

| Property    | What It Means                    | PostgreSQL Mechanism           |
|-------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Atomicity   | All or nothing                   | Transaction rollback           |
| Consistency | Data stays valid                 | Constraints, triggers          |
| Isolation   | Transactions run separately      | MVCC, isolation levels         |
| Durability  | Changes persist after crashes    | Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)      |

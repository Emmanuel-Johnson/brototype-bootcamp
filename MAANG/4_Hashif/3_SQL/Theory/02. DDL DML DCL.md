## ðŸ”µ DDL â€“ Data Definition Language

> **Definition:** Defines the structure/schema of the database.

DDL commands are used to design and modify tables â€” creating, deleting, or altering structures.

| Command   | Purpose                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| CREATE    | Create tables or databases                   |
| ALTER     | Modify existing tables (add/remove columns)  |
| DROP      | Delete tables or databases                   |
| TRUNCATE  | Remove all records from a table (keep structure) |
| RENAME    | Rename a table or column                     |

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);

ALTER TABLE students ADD email VARCHAR(255);

DROP TABLE students;
```

## ðŸŸ¢ DML â€“ Data Manipulation Language

> **Definition:** Handles actual data within the tables.

DML is where CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations happen.

| Command   | Purpose                |
|-----------|------------------------|
| INSERT    | Add new records        |
| UPDATE    | Modify existing records|
| DELETE    | Delete existing records|
| SELECT    | Retrieve records (technically DQL, but often included) |

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Emmanuel', 22);

UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE name = 'Emmanuel';

DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 18;
```

## ðŸŸ£ DCL â€“ Data Control Language

> **Definition:** Manages permissions and access control.

DCL commands control access rights to the database.

| Command   | Purpose                   |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| GRANT     | Give privileges to users  |
| REVOKE    | Take away privileges      |

**Example:**
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON students TO emmanuel_user;

REVOKE INSERT ON students FROM emmanuel_user;
```

## âš¡ Bonus: TCL â€“ Transaction Control Language

> Mention this for extra points in interviews!

| Command    | Purpose                        |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| COMMIT     | Save all changes              |
| ROLLBACK   | Undo changes                  |
| SAVEPOINT  | Mark a point to roll back to  |
| BEGIN      | Start a transaction           |

### ðŸ§  Interview Explanation

In PostgreSQL, SQL commands are categorized into DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and DCL (Data Control Language), each serving a specific purpose in database operations. DDL handles the structure of the database using commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to define or modify tables and schemas. DML deals with the actual data â€” commands like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT are used to manipulate and retrieve records. DCL is focused on access control, using GRANT and REVOKE to manage permissions for users and roles. Together, these three categories cover the full lifecycle of managing data and structure in PostgreSQL, from designing the schema to securely accessing and modifying the data in real-time applications.

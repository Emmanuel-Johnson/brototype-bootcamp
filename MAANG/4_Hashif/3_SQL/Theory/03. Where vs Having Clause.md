## WHERE Clause
- Filters rows **before** any grouping (`GROUP BY`) is applied.
- Operates on individual rows in the table.
- **Cannot** use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 1000;
```

## HAVING Clause
- Filters groups **after** `GROUP BY` is applied.
- Operates on aggregated data.
- **Can** use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

## Interview Explanation

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between WHERE and HAVING?

**A:**  
‚ÄúWHERE is used to filter rows before grouping, whereas HAVING filters groups after aggregation. WHERE works on raw data, HAVING works on aggregated results. For example, use WHERE to get products over 1000 rupees, and HAVING to get categories with more than 10 products.‚Äù

## üî• Bonus Real-Time Example

Suppose you have a sales table:

| id | product | category | price |
|----|---------|----------|-------|
| 1  | A       | Shoes    | 1000  |
| 2  | B       | Shoes    | 1200  |
| 3  | C       | Bags     | 800   |
| 4  | D       | Bags     | 900   |

**Find categories where total price of products is greater than 2000:**

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(price) AS total_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
HAVING SUM(price) > 2000;
```

> You **cannot** use `WHERE SUM(price) > 2000` ‚Äì that would throw an error ‚ùå.

## üß† Interview Explanation 

In PostgreSQL, the WHERE clause is used to filter records before any grouping or aggregation takes place. It operates directly on the raw rows in a table and is typically used with statements like SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE. Since it filters individual records, it cannot include aggregate functions like SUM() or AVG(). Instead, it's used to narrow down the dataset by applying conditions on columns, such as filtering rows where a price is above a certain value or where a status equals 'active'. This clause forms the first layer of filtration in most queries and is foundational for efficient and precise data retrieval.

The HAVING clause, on the other hand, is used after the GROUP BY clause and works on aggregated results. It filters groups created by GROUP BY, not individual rows. This makes it perfect for conditions involving aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), or AVG(). For example, you‚Äôd use HAVING to return only those product categories where the total sales exceed a specific amount. While WHERE limits the rows going into a group, HAVING limits the groups coming out. In PostgreSQL queries involving aggregation, HAVING is essential for refining grouped data and extracting meaningful summaries from large datasets.

## 1. What is UNION?

**UNION** is a SQL operation that combines the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set, removing duplicates by default. It merges lists and keeps only unique entries.

## 2. Why is UNION Important?

Use UNION to gather data from multiple sources (tables or queries) with the same structure. It consolidates results into one dataset, ensuring duplicates don’t affect your data.

## 3. How Does UNION Work?

- Each `SELECT` must have the same number of columns and compatible data types in the same order.
- `UNION` removes duplicate rows by default (distinct union).
- To keep duplicates (and improve performance), use `UNION ALL`.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```
*Returns all unique names from both employees and contractors.*

To include duplicates:

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

## 4. When Should You Use UNION?

- To combine datasets from multiple tables or queries with the same column structure.
- When you want to consolidate similar data sets without duplicates (`UNION`).
- When duplicates matter or for better performance (`UNION ALL`).

> ⚡ To join tables horizontally (combine columns), use `JOIN`.  
> ⚡ For intersection or difference, use `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPT`.

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros**
- ✅ Easily merges multiple query results vertically.
- ✅ Removes duplicates automatically (unless using `UNION ALL`).
- ✅ Useful for consolidating reports and aggregated data.

**Cons**
- ❌ Can be slower due to duplicate removal (unless using `UNION ALL`).
- ❌ All queries must have matching column counts and compatible data types.
- ❌ Not suitable for combining unrelated columns (use `JOIN` instead).

### 🧠 Interview Explanation

"UNION in PostgreSQL is a SQL operation that combines the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set, removing duplicates by default. It’s useful when you want to merge datasets from multiple tables or queries with the same column structure into one clean list without duplicates. Each SELECT must have the same number of columns with compatible data types in the same order. If you want to keep duplicates and gain performance, you can use UNION ALL. While UNION simplifies vertical data merging, it can be slower due to duplicate elimination, and it’s not suitable for combining unrelated columns—that’s when JOINs come into play."

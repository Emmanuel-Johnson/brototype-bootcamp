# ACID 

## What
ACID is an acronym that stands for four key properties that guarantee database transactions are reliable and safe:

- **Atomicity**
- **Consistency** 
- **Isolation**
- **Durability**

## Why
We want ACID to make sure:

- Transactions either complete fully or not at all (no half-done stuff)
- Data stays accurate and valid before and after transactions
- Multiple transactions don't mess each other up
- Once data is saved, it won't disappear even if the system crashes

## How

### Atomicity
- The whole transaction is one unit
- If anything fails, the whole transaction rolls back
- **Example:** When transferring money, either both debit and credit happen or neither

### Consistency
- Transactions move the database from one valid state to another
- All rules, constraints, triggers stay intact

### Isolation
- Transactions run as if they are alone
- Intermediate changes in one transaction aren't visible to others until committed
- PostgreSQL supports multiple isolation levels (Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)

### Durability
- Once committed, changes are permanentâ€”even if the server crashes immediately after
- PostgreSQL uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to ensure durability

## In PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL fully supports ACID compliance out of the box with its MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) engine. You don't have to do extra work; just use transactions properly:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

If you hit an error after `BEGIN` but before `COMMIT`, just run:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## ðŸ§  Interview Explanation

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, the four fundamental properties that ensure database transactions are reliable and safe. Atomicity guarantees that a transaction is all-or-nothingâ€”either fully completed or fully rolled back, preventing partial updates. Consistency ensures that every transaction moves the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all integrity rules. Isolation means transactions execute independently without interfering, with changes invisible to others until committed; PostgreSQL supports multiple isolation levels like Read Committed and Serializable. Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes persist even if the system crashes, with PostgreSQLâ€™s Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism ensuring this. PostgreSQL implements ACID by default using MVCC, so as long as you properly use BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK, your transactions remain robust and trustworthy.

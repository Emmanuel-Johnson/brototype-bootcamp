# Reading Environment Variables

Python’s `os` module allows interaction with environment variables via `os.environ`, which behaves like a dictionary storing all environment variables and their values.

You can access a variable directly with `os.environ['VARIABLE_NAME']`, but this raises a `KeyError` if the variable isn’t set.

A safer way is `os.environ.get('VARIABLE_NAME', default_value)`, which returns `None` or the specified default if the variable doesn’t exist, avoiding exceptions.

`os.getenv()` is a simpler, built-in way to retrieve environment variables in Python, functionally equivalent to `os.environ.get()`.

For managing environment variables from a `.env` file during development, you can use the `python-dotenv` package. It loads the variables into the environment so they become accessible through `os.environ`. For example:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # Load from .env file

value = os.environ.get('VARIABLE_NAME')
print(value)
```

`load_dotenv()` loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the system environment so they can be accessed using `os.getenv()` or `os.environ`.

This approach helps keep sensitive data like API keys or credentials out of source code and makes configuration flexible across environments.

# Static and Class Methods

Static and class methods are special types of methods within a class that serve different purposes:

## Static Methods
- **Definition**: Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
- **Binding**: They are bound to the class and not to a specific instance of the class.
- **Access**: Static methods cannot access or modify class or instance-specific data.
- **Parameters**: They do not have a special first parameter like `self` (for instance methods) or `cls` (for class methods). They behave like regular functions.
- **Use Case**: Static methods are used for utility functions or helper methods that are logically related to the class but don't require access to its state.

## Class Methods
- **Definition**: Class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.
- **Binding**: They are bound to the class itself.
- **Access**: Class methods can access and modify class-level data.
- **Parameters**: They take the class itself as the first parameter, conventionally named `cls`.
- **Use Case**: Class methods are used for factory methods (creating instances of the class with specific configurations) or for operations that need to modify or access class-level data.

## Key Differences

| Feature             | Class Method                     | Static Method                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Binding**         | Bound to the class              | Not bound to class or instance   |
| **First Parameter** | Takes `cls` (the class itself)  | No special first parameter       |
| **Access to Data**  | Can access and modify class-level data | Cannot access class/instance data |
| **Common Use Cases**| Factory methods, class-level behavior | Utility functions, helper methods |

## Example

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = 0

    def __init__(self, instance_variable):
        self.instance_variable = instance_variable

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls, value):
        cls.class_variable = value
        print(f"Class variable updated to: {cls.class_variable}")

    @staticmethod
    def static_method(a, b):
        return a + b

# Using the methods
MyClass.class_method(10)
result = MyClass.static_method(5, 3)
print(f"Result of static method: {result}")

instance = MyClass(20)
print(f"Class variable after class method call: {MyClass.class_variable}")
print(f"Instance variable: {instance.instance_variable}")
```

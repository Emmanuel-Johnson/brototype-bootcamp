# What Can Be Unpacked

In Python, unpacking refers to extracting elements from iterable objects (like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, etc.) and assigning them to variables. This enhances code readability and allows flexible assignment of values. Here's what can be unpacked:

## Lists and Tuples
Elements are unpacked based on position.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
a, b, c = my_list
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
```

## Sets
Sets are iterable but unordered, so unpacked values may appear in any order.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
a, b, c = my_set
print(a, b, c)  # Order may vary
```

## Strings
Strings are iterable character by character.

```python
x, y, z = "abc"
print(x, y, z)  # Output: a b c
```

## Dictionaries
- `*dict` unpacks the keys.
- `**dict` unpacks key-value pairs into function arguments.

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
keys = [*my_dict]  # ['a', 'b']

def my_function(a, b):
    print(a, b)
my_function(**my_dict)  # Output: 1 2
```

## Function Arguments
Use `*` for positional and `**` for keyword arguments.

```python
def my_func(a, b, c): 
    print(a, b, c)

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_func(*my_list)  # Output: 1 2 3
```

## Ranges
`range()` is iterable and can be unpacked.

```python
my_range = range(5)
my_list = [*my_range]  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Ignoring Values
The underscore `_` is often used to skip values.

```python
_, b, _ = [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # Output: 2
```

## Nested Unpacking
Python supports unpacking nested structures.

```python
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[a, b], [c, d]] = nested
print(a, b, c, d)  # Output: 1 2 3 4
```

## ✅ Summary
So in Python, any iterable — including lists, tuples, strings, sets, dictionaries, ranges, and even nested structures — can be unpacked as long as the structure matches the assignment.

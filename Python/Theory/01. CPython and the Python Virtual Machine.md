# CPython

CPython is the original and most widely used implementation of the Python programming language. It is written primarily in C, with some parts of the standard library written in Python, and it is considered the reference implementation.

CPython functions as both a compiler and an interpreter: it compiles Python source code into bytecode, which is a low-level, intermediate representation. Then, the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) interprets and executes this bytecode.

In essence, CPython provides the foundation for how Python code is executed and serves as the default and primary implementation used by most Python developers worldwide.

## Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

The Python Virtual Machine, commonly known as the CPython Virtual Machine, is the core runtime environment responsible for executing Python code. When Python code runs, it is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecodeâ€”a low-level, platform-independent set of instructions. The PVM reads and interprets this bytecode, executing the instructions one by one.

It also manages the runtime environment, including memory allocation, garbage collection, and system calls, while abstracting away the complexities of the underlying hardware. The most popular Python implementation is CPython, which features a PVM written in C. Alternatives like Jython and IronPython allow Python code to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET platforms, respectively.

# Pickling

Pickling in Python refers to the process of serializing a Python object into a byte stream. This allows the object to be stored in a file, transmitted over a network, or saved for later use. The reverse process, converting a byte stream back into a Python object, is called **unpickling**.

The `pickle` module is used to perform pickling and unpickling. It provides functions like `pickle.dump()` to serialize an object to a file and `pickle.load()` to deserialize an object from a file.

## Applications of Pickling

- **Saving program state**: Allows a program to resume from where it left off.
- **Data transfer**: Enables sending Python data over networks or between processes.
- **Object persistence**: Facilitates storing Python objects in databases or files.
- **Caching**: Allows storing intermediate results to avoid recomputation.

> **Warning**: Be cautious when unpickling data from untrusted sources, as malicious code can be embedded in pickled data.

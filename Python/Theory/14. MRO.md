# MRO (Method Resolution Order)

MRO stands for Method Resolution Order. It is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute when a class is involved in inheritance, especially multiple inheritance.

When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, Python needs to know which method to run if the same method exists in more than one parent. MRO helps decide that.

Python uses a rule called **C3 linearization**, which follows these principles:

1. It looks in the current class first.
2. Then it checks parent classes from left to right, based on how they’re listed in the class definition.
3. It ensures the order is consistent and avoids conflicts.

You can see the MRO of a class using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute.

Here’s a quick example:

```python
class A:
    def show(self): 
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self): 
        print("B")

class C(A):
    pass

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.show()  # Output: B
```

In this case, Python checks `D`, then `B`, then `C`, and finally `A`.

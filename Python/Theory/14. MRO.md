# MRO (Method Resolution Order)

Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the order in which base classes are searched when resolving method calls in a class hierarchy, especially in cases of multiple inheritance. Python uses the **C3 linearization algorithm** to create a consistent and predictable MRO.

### The C3 Algorithm Ensures:
1. **Children precede their parents**: A class is always placed before its parent classes in the MRO.
2. **Preservation of inheritance order**: If a class inherits from multiple classes, the order of those classes in the inheritance list is maintained in the MRO.
3. **Monotonicity**: The MRO of a class remains consistent even when new subclasses are created.

### Inspecting the MRO
You can inspect the MRO of a class using either the `__mro__` attribute or the `mro()` method. For example:

```python
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(A):
    pass

class D(B, C):
    pass

print(D.__mro__)  # Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
print(D.mro())    # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]
```

In this example, the MRO for class `D` is `D`, `B`, `C`, `A`, and `object`, which is the order in which Python will search for methods when called on an instance of `D`.

### Why Understanding MRO Matters
Understanding MRO is crucial for working with multiple inheritance in Python, as it helps avoid issues like method conflicts and ensures that methods are resolved in a logical and predictable manner.

# `__pycache__`

`__pycache__` is a directory created by Python to store compiled bytecode files of Python modules. When you import a module, Python compiles it into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of your code. This bytecode is saved in `.pyc` files within the `__pycache__` directory.

The purpose of `__pycache__` is to speed up future imports. When a module is imported again, Python will first check if a corresponding `.pyc` file exists in the `__pycache__` folder. If it does and is up-to-date with the source file, Python will directly load the bytecode from the `.pyc` file instead of recompiling the source file. This can save time, especially for large projects with many modules.

`__pycache__` directories are automatically created in the install location when a module is installed via `pip`. The standard library also has precompiled `__pycache__` directories.

It is generally recommended to ignore `__pycache__` directories in version control systems like Git. They are automatically generated and can be recreated by Python if needed. Including them in your `.gitignore` file is a common practice.

You can safely delete the `__pycache__` directory or its contents. Python will recreate the bytecode files the next time the program runs, if necessary.

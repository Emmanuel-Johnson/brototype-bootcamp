# The nonlocal Keyword

The `nonlocal` keyword in Python is used inside a nested function to refer to variables defined in the nearest enclosing (outer) function’s scope. It allows the inner function to modify variables that belong to the outer function without creating a new local variable.

## How it Works

When you define a function inside another function, the inner function can access variables from the outer function, but it cannot assign to them directly unless you declare them as `nonlocal`.

Without `nonlocal`, assigning to a variable inside the inner function creates a new local variable, shadowing the outer variable instead of modifying it.

Using `nonlocal` tells Python that the variable exists in the immediately enclosing function’s scope, so any changes affect that outer variable.

### Example

```python
def outer_func():
    outer_var = 10
    def inner_func():
        nonlocal outer_var
        outer_var = 20
        print(f"Inner function: outer_var = {outer_var}")
    inner_func()
    print(f"Outer function: outer_var = {outer_var}")

outer_func()
```

**Output:**

```
Inner function: outer_var = 20
Outer function: outer_var = 20
```

## Difference from `global`

- `global` is used to modify variables at the module (global) level.
- `nonlocal` only affects variables in the nearest enclosing function, not the global scope.

In short, `nonlocal` enables nested functions to modify outer function variables, which helps in managing state without relying on globals or creating new local variables.

# Context Manager

Context managers in Python are a way to manage resources, ensuring they are properly set up and cleaned up, even if errors occur. They are commonly used with the `with` statement.

## How Context Managers Work

Context managers rely on two special methods:

- `__enter__()`: This method is called when the `with` block is entered. It sets up the resource and can return an object that will be used within the `with` block.
- `__exit__()`: This method is called when the `with` block is exited, regardless of whether the block completed successfully or an exception occurred. It cleans up the resource.

### Example: File Handling

```python
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, context manager!")
```

In this example:

- `open("my_file.txt", "w")` creates a file object.
- The `__enter__()` method of the file object is called, which opens the file.
- The file object is assigned to the variable `f`.
- The `write()` method is called within the `with` block.
- When the `with` block exits, the `__exit__()` method of the file object is automatically called, which closes the file, even if an error occurred during the writing process.

## Benefits of Using Context Managers

- **Resource Management**: Ensures that resources are released, preventing leaks.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a consistent way to handle errors and ensure cleanup occurs.
- **Readability**: Makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Creating Custom Context Managers

You can create your own context managers by:

1. Defining a class with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.
2. Using the `@contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module.

### Example: Custom Context Manager Class

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context")

with MyContextManager() as manager:
    print("Inside context")
```

### Example: Custom Context Manager with Decorator

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context_manager():
    print("Entering context")
    yield
    print("Exiting context")

with my_context_manager():
    print("Inside context")
```

In summary, context managers in Python provide a structured and reliable way to manage resources, ensuring proper setup and cleanup, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

## Common Examples of Resources

Here are some common examples of resources, along with their usage and cleanup requirements:

| Resource               | Example                          | Cleanup Needed                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **File**               | `open('file.txt')`              | Close the file after reading/writing |
| **Network connection** | Connecting to a server or API   | Close the connection               |
| **Database connection**| Connecting to a database (e.g., SQLite) | Commit/rollback, then close       |
| **Lock (for threading)**| `threading.Lock()`             | Release the lock                   |
| **Temporary memory object** | Like opening an image or sound file | Free up memory                    |

# Super `__init__`

In Python, `super()` is a built-in function used to call methods of a parent class. It is particularly useful when working with inheritance, especially during the initialization of subclasses. When used with the `__init__` method, `super()` ensures that the parent class's initialization logic is executed before the subclass adds its specific initialization.

## Purpose

### 1. Initialization of Parent Class Attributes
When a subclass inherits from a parent class, it often needs to initialize attributes defined in the parent class. `super().__init__()` allows the subclass to call the parent class's `__init__()` method, ensuring that these inherited attributes are properly initialized.

### 2. Method Resolution Order (MRO)
Python uses the MRO to determine the order in which methods are called in a class hierarchy. `super()` respects the MRO, ensuring that the correct `__init__()` method of the parent class is called, even in complex inheritance scenarios.

### 3. Avoiding Redundancy
Without `super()`, you might have to duplicate the parent class's initialization code in the subclass's `__init__()`. `super()` promotes code reusability and maintainability.

## Syntax

```python
class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name)  # Calls the Parent's __init__ method
        self.age = age
```

## Example

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Salary: {self.salary}")

class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name, salary, department):
        super().__init__(name, salary)  # Initialize name and salary from Employee
        self.department = department

    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()  # Call Employee's display_info first
        print(f"Department: {self.department}")

manager = Manager("Alice", 80000, "Sales")
manager.display_info()
```

### Output

```
Name: Alice, Salary: 80000
Department: Sales
```

## Key Points

- `super()` should be used inside the subclass's `__init__` method to call the parent's `__init__`.
- `super()` takes no arguments when used to call the parent class's method.
- It ensures that the parent class is initialized before the subclass adds its specific initializations.
- It follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to call the correct parent class method.
- It promotes code reusability and maintainability by preventing code duplication.

In summary, `super().__init__()` is a crucial part of object-oriented programming in Python, ensuring proper initialization when working with inheritance.

# File Handling

File handling in Python involves performing operations such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

The `open()` function is used to open a file. It typically takes two arguments: the filename and the mode. The mode specifies how the file will be used. Common modes include:

- `'r'`: Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading. Raises an error if the file does not exist.
- `'w'`: Write mode. Opens a file for writing, creating it if it doesnâ€™t exist, or overwriting it if it does.
- `'a'`: Append mode. Opens a file for writing, adding new data to the end without deleting existing content.
- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists.
- `'r+'`: Read and write mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file must already exist.

Once a file is opened, you can perform operations using various methods:

- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file.
- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time from the file.
- `readlines()`: Reads all lines and returns them as a list.
- `write()`: Writes a string to the file.
- `writelines()`: Writes a list of strings to the file. *(Note: does not automatically add newline characters.)*
- `seek()`: Moves the file cursor to a specific position (in bytes).
- `tell()`: Returns the current position of the file cursor.

It is important to close the file using the `close()` method after completing operations to free up system resources. Alternatively, you can use a `with` statement, which automatically closes the file when the block is exited, even if an error occurs.

The `os` module provides additional file manipulation functions, such as renaming or deleting files.

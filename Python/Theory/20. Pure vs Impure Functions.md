# Pure vs Impure Functions

## Pure Functions 
- A pure function always returns the same output for the same input.
- It has no side effects, meaning it does not modify any external state or variables.
- It only depends on its inputs and internal logic.
- Examples include mathematical functions like `sqrt()`, `pow()`, and simple string operations.

## Impure Functions
- An impure function can return different outputs for the same input, or not return anything at all.
- It has side effects such as modifying external variables, printing to the console, or writing to files.
- It may depend on external state or variables outside of its scope.
- Examples include functions that use random number generators, modify global variables, or interact with external systems.

## Key Differences
| Aspect         | Pure Functions                          | Impure Functions                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Predictability** | Always produce the same result for the same input. | Unpredictable due to side effects.      |
| **Side Effects**   | No side effects.                     | Have side effects.                      |
| **Mutability**     | Do not modify external state.        | May modify external state.              |
| **Testability**    | Easier to test due to consistent behavior. | Harder to test due to external dependencies. |

## Example

### Python

```python
# Pure Function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Impure Function
total = 0
def add_to_total(x):
    global total
    total += x
    return total
```

In the example above:
- `add` is a pure function because it always returns the same result for the same inputs and has no side effects.
- `add_to_total` is an impure function because it modifies the global variable `total`, and thus its output can change even with the same input.

> **Note:**  
> Python does not strictly enforce pure functions. It is up to the programmer to understand and implement them correctly.

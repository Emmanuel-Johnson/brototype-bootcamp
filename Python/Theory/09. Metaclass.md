# Metaclass

Metaclasses in Python are classes that define how other classes should behave. They are the "classes of classes," controlling the creation and behavior of classes, similar to how classes control the creation and behavior of objects.

Every class in Python is an instance of a metaclass. The default metaclass is `type`. When a class is defined, Python uses its metaclass to create the class object.

Metaclasses are used for various purposes, including:

- **Customizing class creation**: Metaclasses can modify class attributes, add or remove methods, and change inheritance hierarchies.
- **Enforcing constraints**: They can ensure that classes have specific attributes or methods.
- **Implementing singletons**: Metaclasses can restrict a class to have only one instance.
- **Implementing class factories**: They can dynamically create classes based on input parameters.
- **Metaprogramming**: Metaclasses enable code to manipulate other code at runtime.

Metaclasses are powerful but complex. They are often considered "deeper magic" and are not needed for most programming tasks. However, understanding metaclasses provides a deeper knowledge of Python's class system.

## Example of a Metaclass

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['my_attribute'] = 'Hello from metaclass!'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass

print(MyClass.my_attribute) # Output: Hello from metaclass!
```

In this example, `MyMeta` is a metaclass that adds the attribute `my_attribute` to `MyClass`.

# New Method

In Python, the `__new__` method is a special static method that is called before the `__init__` method when creating a new instance of a class. It is responsible for creating and returning the new object.

## Key Aspects

### Purpose
The `__new__` method is primarily used to control the object creation process. It allows customization of how objects are instantiated.

### When It's Called
It is called before `__init__` and is responsible for actually creating the object in memory.

### Arguments
It takes the class itself (`cls`) as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments that will be passed to `__init__`.

### Return Value
It must return a new instance of the class. If it doesn't, `__init__` will not be called.

## Common Use Cases
- **Singletons**: Ensuring that only one instance of a class exists.
- **Creating immutable objects** like custom tuple or str subclasses
- **Metaclasses**: Customizing how classes themselves are created.

## Difference from `__init__`
- `__new__` creates the object, while `__init__` initializes it.
- `__new__` is called before `__init__`.

## Overriding `__new__`
Usually, you don't need to override `__new__`, as Python handles object creation. However, you can override it when you need to customize the object creation process.

## Example

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Creating instance")
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return instance

    def __init__(self, value):
        print("Initializing instance")
        self.value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
```

In this example, the `__new__` method is called first, followed by the `__init__` method.

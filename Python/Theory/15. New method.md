# New Method

In Python, the `__new__` method is a special static method used for object creation. It is called before the `__init__` method. While `__init__` initializes an object, `__new__` is responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class.

## Key Points About `__new__`

### Object Creation
- `__new__` is the first method called when creating an instance of a class. It is responsible for allocating memory for the new object.

### Static Method
- It's a static method, meaning it belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of the class.

### First Argument
- The first argument of `__new__` is always the class itself (`cls`).

### Return Value
- It must return a new instance of the class. If it doesn't, the `__init__` method will not be called.

### Customization
- `__new__` can be overridden to control the object creation process. This is useful for implementing patterns like the singleton pattern, where only one instance of a class is allowed.

### Immutable Classes
- It's often used when inheriting from immutable classes to control how instances are created.

### Bypassing `__init__`
- You can completely bypass `__init__` by using only `__new__`, although this is not common practice.

## Example

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Creating instance")
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return instance

    def __init__(self, value):
        print("Initializing instance")
        self.value = value

obj = MyClass(10)
print(obj.value)
```

### Explanation
In this example:
1. `__new__` is called first, printing "Creating instance".
2. Then, `__init__` is called, printing "Initializing instance".
3. Finally, the value is printed.

## Summary
`__new__` is a powerful tool for customizing object creation in Python, but it's not needed for most common use cases.

# Trie (Prefix Tree)

## 1. What is it?
A **Trie** is a **tree-like data structure** used to store a **dynamic set of strings**, especially optimized for **prefix-based retrieval**.

## 2. Why it matters?
Tries allow **fast lookup of words and prefixes**, making them ideal for:
- **Autocomplete**
- **Spell-checking**
- **Dictionary-related operations**

## 3. How it works?
- Each node represents a **character**.
- Traversing from the **root to a leaf** spells out a word.
- **Insertion** and **search** happen by going through each character **one at a time**.

## 4. Example / Analogy
üì± **Contact list analogy**:
Typing `"em"` filters all names starting with `"em"` ‚Äî  
a **Trie** helps do this **efficiently** by organizing characters in shared paths.

## 5. When to use it?
Use a Trie when you need:
- **Fast prefix-based operations**
- **Word suggestions** (e.g., search engines)
- **Prefix matching** or implementing **dictionaries**

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Fast prefix search**
- **Avoids repeated storage** of common prefixes
- Efficient insert/search in **O(L)** time (L = length of word)

### ‚ùå Cons
- **High memory usage**, especially for **sparse datasets**
- More complex than simpler structures like hash maps

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hash Maps** ‚Äì for direct key-value lookups
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **Radix Trees** ‚Äì compressed version of Tries
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** ‚Äì often used in traversal

## 8. Conclusion
**Tries** are powerful structures for managing **sets of strings** with **shared prefixes**.  
They offer efficient operations with **O(L)** time complexity for both **insertion** and **search**, making them ideal for text-based applications.

# Tree vs Trie: Data Structure Comparison

## Definition

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| A **hierarchical** data structure with a root and child nodes | A special type of tree used to store strings, especially for **prefix lookup** |

## Structure

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Nodes can contain any type of data (int, char, object, etc.) | Each node stores a **character** (or part of a string) |

## Use Case

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| General-purpose: binary tree, AVL, heap, etc. | Efficient for word dictionary, autocomplete, spell-check, etc. |

## Edge Meaning

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Represents a relationship (parent ‚Üí child) | Represents a **character transition** from one prefix to the next |

## Key Operations

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Search | Insert Word, Search Word, Prefix Search |

## Time Complexity

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Depends on type (BST: O(log n), Binary Tree: O(n)) | Insert/Search: O(L), where L is length of the word |

## Space Complexity

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| O(n) for n nodes | High space in worst case (many branches per character node) |

## Example

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Heap, etc. | Dictionary of words: `cat`, `car`, `care` |

## Node Contents

| **Tree** | **Trie** |
|----------|----------|
| Value (data) and pointers to children | Character, boolean flag for end of word, children (26 pointers in English) |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

| **Use Case** | **Use** |
|--------------|---------|
| Storing hierarchical data | Tree |
| Autocomplete, prefix-based search | Trie |
| Balanced sorting or range searching | AVL, BST (Tree) |
| Fast retrieval of strings with shared prefixes | Trie |

## üîÅ Analogy

- **Tree**: Like a **family tree** ‚Äî shows how people are related
- **Trie**: Like a **phonebook** ‚Äî you type the beginning of a name and get matching entries quickly

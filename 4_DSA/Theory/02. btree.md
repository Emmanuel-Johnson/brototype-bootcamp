# B-Tree

## 1. What is it?  
A B-Tree is a self-balancing multi-way search tree that maintains sorted data and allows fast insertions, deletions, and searches.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It's widely used in databases and file systems because it minimizes disk access by keeping data balanced and shallow.

## 3. How it works?  
Each node can have multiple keys and children; nodes split or merge as needed to keep the tree balanced after insert/delete.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a library index where each drawer (node) holds many entries (keys), and points to sub-drawers (children) for efficient lookups.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use it when working with large data stored on disk, where minimizing I/O operations is critical.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Efficient disk access, balanced height.  
❌ More complex insert/delete logic compared to binary trees.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, B+ Tree, 2-3 Tree, Red-Black Tree.

## 8. Conclusion  
B-Trees are optimal for systems that read/write large blocks of data, offering balance and performance at scale.

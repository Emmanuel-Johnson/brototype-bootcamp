# üåü Linear Probing in Hash Tables ‚Äì Explained Simply

## üß† 1. What Is a Hash Table?

Before we get to linear probing, let's first understand a hash table.

A hash table is like a smart array that stores data using keys. For example:

```python
student["name"] = "Emmanuel"
```

Here, "name" is the key, and "Emmanuel" is the value.

**But how does it work?**

Behind the scenes, the key is passed through a hash function to turn it into a number (called hash code), and that number decides where the value goes in the array.

```python
index = hash("name") % table_size
```

## üöß 2. What Is a Collision?

Let's say we have a small array (size = 5). If two keys give the same index after hashing, we have a collision.

Imagine:

```python
hash("cat") % 5 = 2  
hash("dog") % 5 = 2
```

Now both "cat" and "dog" want to go to index 2. That's a collision.

## üîÅ 3. What Is Linear Probing?

Linear Probing is one way to solve that collision.

‚úÖ Instead of creating a list or using more memory, we just move forward one by one in the same array to find the next empty spot.

**Example:**

Let's say:
- Table size = 5
- "cat" wants to go to index 2 ‚Äî ‚úÖ slot 2 is empty ‚Üí store it.
- "dog" also hashes to index 2 ‚Äî ‚ùå slot is taken ‚Üí check index 3 ‚Üí if it's empty, store there.
- If index 3 is also full ‚Üí check index 4 ‚Üí and so on. If we reach the end, we go back to index 0.

This wrap-around is done using:

```python
(index + 1) % table_size
```

## üì¶ Think of it like:

You're finding parking in a small lot. If your assigned spot is taken, you keep moving forward, car by car, until you find the next available space.

## üí• 4. What Is Clustering?

Now let's understand clustering, which is a big issue in linear probing.

### ü§î What's Clustering?

When many items get stored next to each other (due to collisions), it creates a cluster ‚Äî a big group of filled slots.

Now, when you try to insert something new, you have to search through all of them to find the next empty slot ‚Äî this takes longer time.

### üîÑ Example:

Let's say index 2 to 6 are filled. Now if a new item also hashes to index 2, we will search 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 until we get an empty slot at 7.

The more crowded it becomes, the slower it gets. This is clustering.

## üßÆ 5. What Is Load Factor?

The load factor tells us how full the hash table is.

**Formula:**
```
Load Factor = number of elements / size of table
```

For example, if:
- Table size = 10
- 7 elements stored

Then:
```
Load Factor = 7 / 10 = 0.7 (70% full)
```

### üî∫ Why is this important?

If the table gets too full (say load factor > 0.75), collisions and clustering increase, and performance drops. So many systems resize the table when it gets too full.

## ‚úÖ 6. When to Use Linear Probing?

Use it when:
- You want to avoid using extra memory (no linked lists).
- You want better cache performance (everything is in one array).
- Simplicity is more important than perfect performance.

## ‚öñÔ∏è 7. Pros and Cons

| ‚úÖ Pros | ‚ùå Cons |
|---------|---------|
| Easy to implement | Clustering can slow it down |
| No need for extra memory | Slower insert/search when full |
| Better cache locality (fast access) | Resize needed when full |

### üîπ Open Addressing:

Linear probing is part of a bigger family called open addressing. That just means:

All data is stored inside the same array. If a collision happens, we probe (search) for another empty spot.

There are other types of probing too:
- **Quadratic Probing** ‚Üí Try index + 1¬≤, +2¬≤, +3¬≤‚Ä¶
- **Double Hashing** ‚Üí Use another hash function to decide jump size.

### üîπ Hash Function:

A function that turns keys into numbers to find where to store data.

### üîπ Rehashing:

When the table is too full (load factor is high), we make a new bigger table and re-insert all data using the new size.

## üß© 9. Example in Python (Simple)

```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [None] * size

    def insert(self, key, value):
        index = hash(key) % self.size
        start_index = index

        while self.table[index] is not None:
            if self.table[index][0] == key:
                break  # Update existing key
            index = (index + 1) % self.size
            if index == start_index:
                raise Exception("Hash Table is Full")

        self.table[index] = (key, value)

    def display(self):
        for i, item in enumerate(self.table):
            print(f"{i}: {item}")
```

## üß† 10. Final Thoughts (Conclusion)

Linear Probing is a smart and space-efficient way to deal with collisions in hash tables.

- It works by simply checking the next spot in the array.
- It's great for simplicity and cache performance, but be careful of clustering and high load factors.
- For better performance in some cases, consider double hashing or quadratic probing.

# Linear Probing

## 1. What is it?  
Linear probing is a collision resolution technique in hash tables where, upon collision, we linearly search the next available slot.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It keeps all elements in the same array (no chaining), improving cache performance and simplifying memory layout.

## 3. How it works?  
If a hash index is occupied, we check the next index:  
`(index + 1) % table_size`,  
and continue until an empty spot is found.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like finding parking in a full lot ‚Äî if your spot is taken, you move to the next available one.

## 5. When to use it?  
When you want to resolve collisions in open addressing without using additional memory for linked lists.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
‚úÖ Simple to implement, good cache locality.  
‚ùå Can cause clustering (many items crowd together), leading to longer probe times.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Hashing, open addressing, quadratic probing, double hashing, load factor.

## 8. Conclusion  
Linear probing is a simple and space-efficient collision strategy, but needs careful handling of clustering and load factor.

# Quadratic Probing

## 1. What is it?  
Quadratic probing is a collision resolution method in hash tables that resolves collisions by checking slots at quadratic intervals.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It reduces primary clustering compared to linear probing, improving performance when collisions occur.

## 3. How it works?  
If the initial hash index is occupied, we try:  
- `(index + 1¬≤) % size`  
- `(index + 2¬≤) % size`  
- `(index + 3¬≤) % size`  
...and so on until an empty slot is found.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like skipping farther ahead each time you don‚Äôt find an empty parking spot: 1 step, then 4 steps, then 9 steps, etc.

## 5. When to use it?  
When you want better distribution of values in open addressing without the clustering issue of linear probing.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
‚úÖ Reduces clustering.  
‚ùå May still miss empty slots (secondary clustering), and requires careful choice of hash table size.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Hashing, linear probing, double hashing, open addressing, load factor.

## 8. Conclusion  
Quadratic probing balances simplicity and performance in collision handling, offering better spread than linear probing in open addressing.

# Rehashing in Hash Tables

## 1. What is it?
**Rehashing** is the process of **resizing a hash table** and **recomputing hash values** for all existing keys to fit into the new table size.

## 2. Why it matters?
It helps maintain **efficient performance**.  
When the hash table becomes too full, **collisions increase**, slowing down insertions, lookups, and deletions.  
Rehashing reduces collisions and keeps operations fast.

## 3. How it works?
- When the **load factor** (`number of elements √∑ table size`) **exceeds a threshold** (commonly `0.7`), rehashing is triggered.
- A **larger hash table** is created (often **double** the original size).
- All elements are **reinserted** using the new table size and possibly a new hash function, so they‚Äôre **evenly distributed**.

## 4. Example / Analogy
üß∫ Like **moving to a bigger cupboard** and **reorganizing items** so everything fits better and is easier to find.

## 5. When to use it?
Rehashing happens:
- **Automatically** (in most languages/libraries), or  
- **Manually** when the **load factor exceeds a safe threshold** (typically `> 0.7`)

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Keeps hash operations **fast** (`O(1)` average case)  
- **Reduces collisions** and **clustering**

### ‚ùå Cons
- Rehashing takes **O(n)** time  
- Can cause a **temporary slowdown** during resizing

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hashing**
- **Load Factor**
- **Collision Handling** (e.g., chaining, open addressing)
- **Dynamic Arrays** (similar resizing logic)

## 8. Conclusion
**Rehashing** is a critical technique that ensures hash tables stay **efficient** as more elements are added.  
Despite the **one-time cost**, it greatly improves **long-term performance** by reducing collisions and maintaining `O(1)` operations.

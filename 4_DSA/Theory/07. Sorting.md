# Bubble Sort

## 1. What is it?
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## 2. Why it matters?
It's easy to understand and implement, making it great for learning sorting fundamentals and algorithm analysis.

## 3. How it works?
It makes multiple passes through the array; in each pass, larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list through pairwise swaps.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of sorting soda bottles by height‚Äîtaller bottles move to the end with each round of comparisons.

## 5. When to use it?
Use only for educational purposes or very small datasets; not suitable for production due to inefficiency.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Simple to code.  
‚ùå Very slow for large lists (O(n¬≤)), even if partially sorted.

## 7. Related Concepts
Related to Insertion Sort and Selection Sort; often compared with Merge Sort and Quicksort for performance.

## 8. Conclusion
Bubble Sort is an intuitive but inefficient algorithm‚Äîimportant for learning, but rarely used in real-world applications.

## ‚è± Bubble Sort Time Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity |
|------|----------------|
| Best | O(n) *(if optimized with no swaps flag)* |
| Average | O(n¬≤) |
| Worst | O(n¬≤) |
| Space | O(1) *(in-place)* |

---

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False  # Reset at start of pass
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:  # This won't happen
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break  # No swaps ‚Üí array is sorted ‚Üí stop early
```

# Insertion Sort

## 1. What is it?
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time.

## 2. Why it matters?
It‚Äôs efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets and helps build a strong intuition for sorting mechanics.

## 3. How it works?
It iterates through the array and "inserts" each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted portion on its left.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like sorting playing cards in your hand‚Äîeach new card is placed in the correct position among the ones already sorted.

## 5. When to use it?
Ideal for small arrays or when the input is mostly sorted; also useful in hybrid algorithms like Timsort.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Simple and stable.  
‚úÖ Performs well on nearly sorted data.  
‚ùå Slow (O(n¬≤)) for large, unsorted datasets.

## 7. Related Concepts
Related to Bubble Sort and Selection Sort; used in optimized hybrid algorithms like Timsort (used in Python's built-in sort()).

## 8. Conclusion
Insertion Sort is great for small or nearly sorted inputs‚Äîsimple, intuitive, and important for understanding more complex sorting strategies.

## ‚è± Insertion Sort Time Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity |
|------|----------------|
| Best | O(n) *(already sorted list)* |
| Average | O(n¬≤) |
| Worst | O(n¬≤) |
| Space | O(1) *(in-place)* |

---

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    # Traverse from the second element to the end
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1

        # Move elements greater than key one position ahead
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1

        arr[j + 1] = key

# Example usage
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertion_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

---

# Selection Sort

## 1. What is it?
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.

## 2. Why it matters?
It‚Äôs simple to understand and doesn‚Äôt require additional memory, making it a good learning tool.

## 3. How it works?
It divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts, and in each pass, finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like choosing the shortest person from a line and moving them to the front, then repeating with the rest.

## 5. When to use it?
Best for educational purposes or when memory space is extremely limited; not used in practice for large lists.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Easy to implement, needs no extra space.  
‚ùå Always O(n¬≤), even on sorted data.  
‚ùå Not stable.

## 7. Related Concepts
Similar to Bubble and Insertion Sort; less efficient than Merge or Quick Sort.

## 8. Conclusion
While not practical for large inputs, Selection Sort is a great educational tool to understand sorting logic and selection principles.

## ‚è± Selection Sort Time Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity |
|------|----------------|
| Best | O(n¬≤) |
| Average | O(n¬≤) |
| Worst | O(n¬≤) |
| Space | O(1) *(in-place)* |

---

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        # Assume the minimum is the first unsorted element
        min_index = i

        # Find the index of the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j

        # Swap the found minimum element with the first unsorted element
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]

# Example usage
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
selection_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

---

# Quicksort

## 1. What is it?
Quicksort is a highly efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively partitions elements around a pivot.

## 2. Why it matters?
It‚Äôs widely used due to its fast average-case performance and low memory usage‚Äîused internally in many libraries.

## 3. How it works?
It selects a pivot, places all smaller elements to the left, larger to the right, and recursively sorts the partitions.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like organizing books around a reference book: smaller books on one side, larger on the other, then repeat for both sides.

## 5. When to use it?
Best when you need fast, in-place sorting and average performance is more important than guaranteed worst-case time.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Fast (O(n log n) avg), in-place, minimal overhead.  
‚ùå Worst-case O(n¬≤), unstable unless modified.

## 7. Related Concepts
Related to Merge Sort (divide & conquer), Heap Sort (O(n log n) worst-case), and Timsort (used in Python).

## 8. Conclusion
Quicksort is a go-to sorting algorithm in practice‚Äîfast, elegant, and widely adopted, though care must be taken with pivot selection.

## ‚è± Quicksort Time & Space Complexity

## Time Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Best Case** | O(n log n) | *Balanced partitioning* |
| **Average Case** | O(n log n) | |
| **Worst Case** | O(n¬≤) | *Poor pivot choices, e.g., already sorted* |

## Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Space** | O(log n) | *Due to recursion stack in-place* |

## üîπ Practical Example ( Lomuto Partition )

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    def partition(low, high):
        pivot = arr[high]
        i = low - 1

        for j in range(low, high):
            if arr[j] < pivot:
                i += 1
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    def quick_sort_recursive(low, high):
        if low < high:
            pi = partition(low, high)
            quick_sort_recursive(low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort_recursive(pi + 1, high)

    quick_sort_recursive(0, len(arr) - 1)
    return arr
```

# Merge Sort

## 1. What is it?
Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits arrays into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

## 2. Why it matters?
It provides a consistent O(n log n) time complexity in all cases, making it reliable for large datasets.

## 3. How it works?
It recursively divides the array until each subarray has one element, then merges them back in sorted order.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like organizing shuffled playing cards by dividing the deck, sorting small piles, and combining them in order.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when stability is needed or when working with linked lists or very large datasets that require predictable performance.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Stable and consistent O(n log n).  
‚ùå Uses O(n) extra space due to merging.

## 7. Related Concepts
Closely related to Quicksort (also divide-and-conquer), Timsort (which combines Merge + Insertion), and external sorting.

## 8. Conclusion
Merge Sort is dependable and stable, especially for large datasets or cases where worst-case guarantees matter.

## ‚è± Merge Sort Time & Space Complexity

## Time Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity |
|------|----------------|
| Best Case | O(n log n) |
| Average Case | O(n log n) |
| Worst Case | O(n log n) |

## Space Complexity

**Space:** O(n) *(extra space for merging)*

---

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        # Find the middle point
        mid = len(arr) // 2

        # Divide the array into two halves
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        # Recursive call on each half
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        # Merging the two halves
        i = j = k = 0

        # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # Checking if any element was left
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

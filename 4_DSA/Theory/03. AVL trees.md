# AVL Tree

## 1. What is it?  
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference in height between left and right subtrees (balance factor) is at most 1 for every node.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It maintains O(log n) time for insertions, deletions, and lookups by ensuring the tree stays balanced.

## 3. How it works?  
After insertion or deletion, the tree checks balance factors and performs rotations (single or double) to restore balance.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Think of it like a tightrope walker — it keeps adjusting left or right (rotating) to maintain perfect balance while moving forward.

## 5. When to use it?  
When you need fast and consistent search performance, especially where frequent inserts and deletes occur.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Guaranteed balance and O(log n) operations.  
❌ More complex to implement than plain BST due to rotations.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL), Balance Factor.

## 8. Conclusion  
AVL Trees ensure balanced height at all times, making them a reliable choice for efficient dynamic data operations.

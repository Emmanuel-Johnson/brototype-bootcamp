# Collision Handling Methods in Hash Tables

## 1. What is it?
**Collision handling methods** are strategies to manage situations where multiple keys hash to the same index in a hash table.

## 2. Why it matters?
**Collisions are inevitable** in hashing due to limited table size.  
Handling them properly ensures data is **stored and retrieved correctly**.

## 3. How it works?
Popular methods include:

- **Chaining**: Store multiple entries in a **list** at each index.
- **Open Addressing**: Find another empty slot using **probing methods**.

## 4. Example / Analogy
Like **parking cars**:

- **Chaining** = shared parking at the same spot (multiple cars per spot).
- **Open Addressing** = searching for the **next available parking space** if the preferred one is taken.

## 5. When to use it?
- Use **chaining** when **space isn‚Äôt a constraint** (e.g., using linked lists).
- Use **open addressing** when **memory should be compact** (e.g., using arrays).

## 6. Pros and Cons

### üîó Chaining
‚úÖ Easy to implement  
‚ùå Uses extra memory (linked structures)

### üì¶ Open Addressing
‚úÖ Memory efficient (no extra pointers/lists)  
‚ùå Performance degrades as **load factor increases**

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hash Tables**
- **Hash Functions**
- **Load Factor**
- **Probing Techniques**: 
  - Linear Probing  
  - Quadratic Probing  
  - Double Hashing  

## 8. Conclusion
Choosing the **right collision handling method** depends on your use case:
- **Chaining** is more **flexible** and handles high loads better.
- **Open Addressing** is more **memory-efficient** but needs careful probing strategy.

# Common Collision Handling Methods

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Chaining** | Use a linked list (or dynamic array) at each index. | Python's `dict` uses this. |
| **Linear Probing** | Linearly search for next empty slot. | `index = (hash + i) % size` |
| **Quadratic Probing** | Search quadratically farther away. | `index = (hash + i¬≤) % size` |
| **Double Hashing** | Use a second hash function to find the next slot. | `index = (h1 + i * h2) % size` |

# üí• Collision Handling Methods ‚Äì Easy Guide

## 1. What is it?
**Collision handling methods** are ways to fix problems when two keys go to the same index in a hash table.

üß† Hash tables use formulas (**hash functions**), but sometimes different keys give the same result ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **collision**.

## 2. Why is it important?
**Collisions are unavoidable** in hashing.  
If we don‚Äôt handle them:
- Data will be **lost or overwritten**
- Searches will give **wrong results**

‚úÖ So we need a way to store and retrieve data **correctly** even when collisions happen.

## 3. How does it work?
Here are the two main strategies:

### üîó 1. Chaining
- Each index holds a **list** (or linked list) of items.
- If two keys collide, both go into that list.
- Think of it as **sharing a parking spot** ‚Äî both cars (keys) fit, side by side.

### üì¶ 2. Open Addressing
- If a spot is taken, look for another **empty spot nearby** using **probing**:

  - **Linear Probing**: Try next index (1 step at a time).
  - **Quadratic Probing**: Jump further (i¬≤ steps).
  - **Double Hashing**: Use another hash function to decide the jump.

üéØ Like finding another empty parking space nearby.

## 4. Example / Analogy

üöó **Parking Lot Analogy**:

- **Chaining**: Two cars share the same parking spot using valet stacking.
- **Linear Probing**: If your spot is full, check the next one, then next...
- **Quadratic Probing**: Check 1 spot away, then 4 away, then 9...
- **Double Hashing**: Use a second formula to jump to another spot.

## 5. When to use which?

| **Method**        | **When to Use**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chaining**       | When memory isn‚Äôt a big issue, and you want simple logic.      |
| **Open Addressing**| When you're working in a fixed-size array and want to save memory.|

## 6. Pros and Cons

| **Method**        | ‚úÖ **Pros**                     | ‚ùå **Cons**                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Chaining**       | Easy to implement, flexible      | Uses extra memory for lists          |
| **Open Addressing**| Saves space, works in arrays     | Slower if the table is crowded       |

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hash Table**: A fast data storage system using keys  
- **Hash Function**: Converts keys into indexes  
- **Load Factor**: How full the table is  
- **Probing**: How we search for empty spots in open addressing

## 8. Conclusion
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbest‚Äù method ‚Äî it depends on your needs:

- Want **simplicity and flexibility**? ‚û§ Use **Chaining**
- Want **memory efficiency**? ‚û§ Use **Open Addressing**

## ‚úÖ Summary Table of Collision Handling Methods

| **Method**           | **Description**                               | **Example Code / Usage**              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Chaining**          | List at each index to store multiple items    | `dict` in Python uses this             |
| **Linear Probing**    | Try next index: `(hash + i) % size`           | Simple and fast at low load            |
| **Quadratic Probing** | Try: `(hash + i¬≤) % size`                     | Avoids clustering, but more complex    |
| **Double Hashing**    | `(h1 + i √ó h2) % size`                        | Very effective if you have two hashes  |

# Double Hashing

In **double hashing**, the **first hash function** (`h‚ÇÅ`) gives the starting index, just like in normal hashing. If that spot is **already taken (collision)**, we don't just try the next slot (like linear probing). Instead, we use a **second hash function** (`h‚ÇÇ`) to decide **how far to jump** ‚Äî this helps **spread out the keys** and avoid clusters.

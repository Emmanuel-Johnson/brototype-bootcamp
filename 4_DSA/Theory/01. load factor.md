# Load Factor in Hash Tables

## 1. What is it?  
Load factor is the ratio of the number of elements in a hash table to the total number of buckets (slots).

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps measure how full the hash table is and determines when to resize (rehash) to maintain performance.

## 3. How it works?  
Load factor = n / k, where  
- **n** = number of entries  
- **k** = number of buckets  
If it crosses a threshold (e.g., 0.75), rehashing is triggered.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like seating in a classroom: if you have 30 seats and 15 students, the room is half full — load factor is 0.5.

## 5. When to use it?  
Always track load factor in hash-based structures to balance between space usage and lookup performance.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Helps avoid collisions and keeps operations fast.  
❌ Rehashing can be costly if not managed well.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Hashing, collisions, rehashing, open addressing, chaining.

## 8. Conclusion  
Load factor is a key performance metric in hash tables that ensures efficiency by controlling density and guiding resizing.

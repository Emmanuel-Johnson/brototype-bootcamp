# Collision Handling in Hash Tables

## 1. What is it?
**Collision handling** is a technique used in hash tables when two keys hash to the same index.

## 2. Why it matters?
Without handling collisions, **hash tables would lose data or become incorrect**.  
Collision handling ensures the table works properly even when keys clash.

## 3. How it works?
Common methods include:
- **Chaining**: Store multiple values in a **list** at the same index.
- **Open Addressing**: Find another empty slot using **probing** (e.g., linear or quadratic probing).

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like **two people getting the same locker number**:  
- They either **share a locker** (chaining),  
- Or one **moves to the next available locker** (probing).

## 5. When to use it?
**Always required** when using hash tables to ensure reliable:
- Insert operations  
- Delete operations  
- Search operations  

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Keeps hash tables **efficient**
- Maintains **constant-time** operations on average

### ‚ùå Cons
- Can **increase complexity**
- May require **extra memory** or effort to manage collisions

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hash functions**
- **Load factor**
- **Chaining**
- **Linear Probing**
- **Quadratic Probing**
- **Double Hashing**

## 8. Conclusion
**Collision handling** ensures hash tables remain **fast and reliable**,  
even when multiple keys map to the same index.

# üí• Collision Handling ‚Äì Explained Simply

## 1. What is it?
**Collision handling** is how a hash table deals with two keys landing at the same spot (index) in the table.

üîë Think of it like two keys getting assigned the same drawer ‚Äî what do you do now?

## 2. Why is it Important?
Without handling collisions:
- Data gets **overwritten or lost**
- The table becomes **unreliable**

So it‚Äôs crucial for correct **insert**, **search**, and **delete** operations.

## 3. How Does it Work?
There are two main methods:

### ‚úÖ 1. Chaining
- Use a **list or linked list** at each index.
- Store all keys with the same hash in that list.
- Like **sharing a locker**: put both people's things inside.

### ‚úÖ 2. Open Addressing
- If a spot is full, look for the **next empty spot**.
- Use a technique like:
  - **Linear Probing** ‚Äì check next one by one
  - **Quadratic Probing** ‚Äì check squares (i¬≤)
  - **Double Hashing** ‚Äì use another hash to jump
- Like **checking the next locker** if yours is taken.

## 4. Example / Analogy
Imagine a school gives out lockers using a formula, but **two students get locker #5**.

- **Chaining**: Both share locker #5, maybe with their own shelves.
- **Open Addressing**: One gets locker #5, the other tries locker #6, #7, etc., until they find an empty one.

## 5. When to Use It?
**Always** in hash tables!  
Because **collisions are guaranteed** to happen at some point (due to limited size).

## 6. Pros & Cons

| Pros ‚úÖ                             | Cons ‚ùå                                  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Keeps hash table **fast & reliable** | May **slow down** if too many collisions |
| Supports **efficient data handling** | May use **extra memory** (chaining) or be **tricky** (probing) |

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Hash Function** ‚Äì Decides where data goes  
- **Load Factor** ‚Äì How full the table is  
- **Chaining & Probing** ‚Äì Ways to handle collisions  
- **Rehashing** ‚Äì Resize table when too full

## 8. Conclusion
**Collision handling** keeps hash tables working even when two keys land on the same spot.  
It‚Äôs like having a **backup plan** for sharing space ‚Äî making sure no data is lost or overwritten.

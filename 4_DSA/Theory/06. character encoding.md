# Character Encoding

## 1. What is it?  
Character encoding is the process of converting characters (letters, symbols) into binary numbers so they can be stored and processed by computers.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows computers to represent, store, and transmit text from any language in a standardized format.

## 3. How it works?  
Each character is mapped to a unique numeric code (e.g., `'A' = 65` in ASCII, `'‡§Ö' = 2309` in Unicode), which is stored in binary.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like assigning a unique ID to each student in a school ‚Äî instead of names, systems work with ID numbers.

## 5. When to use it?  
Always used when working with strings, files, text processing, networking, and databases.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
‚úÖ Standardized and efficient.  
‚ùå Encoding mismatches can lead to garbled text (e.g., *mojibake*).

## 7. Related Concepts  
ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-16, binary, string manipulation.

## 8. Conclusion  
Character encoding is essential for text handling in computing, enabling global communication and data exchange.

## Example

# Python `ord()` Function - Character Encoding Guide

The `ord()` function in Python is a **direct example of character encoding**.

## üîπ What does `ord()` do?

It **converts a character into its corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) integer value**.

## ‚úÖ Examples of `ord()`:

```python
print(ord('A'))  # 65 ‚Üí ASCII for 'A'
print(ord('a'))  # 97 ‚Üí ASCII for 'a'
print(ord('0'))  # 48 ‚Üí ASCII for '0'
print(ord('‡§Ö'))  # 2309 ‚Üí Unicode for Hindi character '‡§Ö'
```

This is **character encoding in action** ‚Äî converting text (like `'A'` or `'‡§Ö'`) to numeric form so a computer can store or manipulate it.

## üîÅ Related Function: `chr()`

If `ord()` gives the **number from character**, then `chr()` does the **opposite** ‚Äî gives the **character from number**:

```python
print(chr(65))  # 'A'
print(chr(97))  # 'a'
```

## ‚úÖ Summary:

| Function | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ord()` | Char ‚Üí Code (Encoding) | `ord('A') ‚Üí 65` |
| `chr()` | Code ‚Üí Char (Decoding) | `chr(65) ‚Üí 'A'` |

So yes, `ord()` is a **simple and clear example** of how **character encoding** is used in programming and DSA problems.

# üå≥ Binary Tree 

## 1. What is it?
A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most **two children**:  
- a **left child**  
- a **right child**

## 2. Why it matters?
Binary trees form the basis for many essential data structures in computer science, such as:
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**
- **Heaps**
- **Expression Trees**

## 3. How it works?
- Nodes are connected in a **parent-child** relationship.
- Each node may have **0, 1, or 2 children**.
- Trees support efficient operations like:
  - **Insertion**
  - **Deletion**
  - **Traversal** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

## 4. Example / Analogy
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Like a **family tree**, where each person can have **up to two children**, and you can trace relationships from top to bottom.

## 5. When to use it?
Use a binary tree when:
- You are dealing with **hierarchical data**
- You need **efficient searching or sorting**
- You want to represent **expressions** (e.g., in compilers)

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Easy to implement  
- Supports fast traversal and manipulation

### ‚ùå Cons
- Can become **unbalanced**, leading to **inefficient operations**

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree**
- **Heaps**
- **Tree Traversal** techniques
- **Recursion** (often used in tree operations)

## 8. Conclusion
**Binary Trees** are a **fundamental concept** in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
They provide a flexible base for creating **efficient and powerful hierarchical structures**, making them essential for many applications.

# üå≤ Binary Search Tree (BST) 

## 1. What is it?
A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a binary tree where:
- Each node‚Äôs **left child** contains values **less than** the node.
- Each node‚Äôs **right child** contains values **greater than** the node.

This ordering rule is applied **recursively** to every node in the tree.

## 2. Why it matters?
BSTs allow:
- **Efficient search**, **insertion**, and **deletion**  
- With **average time complexity** of `O(log n)` (if balanced)

## 3. How it works?
The **BST property** ensures that during search operations:
- You can **discard half** of the tree at each step  
- Just like **binary search** on a sorted array

## 4. Example / Analogy
üìñ Like a **sorted phone book**:  
To find a name, you keep **dividing the book in half** until you find the entry.

## 5. When to use it?
Use a BST when:
- You need **fast lookups, inserts, and deletions**
- You can ensure or maintain a **balanced tree structure**

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Fast operations** (`O(log n)` average)
- Maintains **sorted order**
- Supports **inorder traversal** to get sorted output

### ‚ùå Cons
- Can degrade to `O(n)` (like a **linked list**) if **unbalanced**

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Binary Tree**
- **AVL Tree** ‚Äì self-balancing BST
- **Red-Black Tree** ‚Äì another balanced BST
- **Tree Traversals**
- **Recursion** ‚Äì used in many BST operations

## 8. Conclusion
**Binary Search Trees** are powerful for managing **ordered data** and **dynamic datasets**.  
To maintain their `O(log n)` efficiency, they should remain **balanced** through self-balancing techniques (like AVL or Red-Black Trees).

# üå≥ AVL Tree 

## 1. What is it?
An **AVL Tree** is a **self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST)** where the **difference in heights** of the left and right subtrees (called the **balance factor**) is **at most 1** for every node.

## 2. Why it matters?
AVL Trees maintain **`O(log n)` time complexity** for:
- **Search**
- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**

Even in the **worst case**, they stay balanced, unlike regular BSTs.

## 3. How it works?
After every **insertion** or **deletion**:
- The tree **checks balance factors** at each node.
- If any node becomes unbalanced, it performs **rotations** to restore balance.

### Types of Rotations:
- **LL (Left-Left)**
- **RR (Right-Right)**
- **LR (Left-Right)**
- **RL (Right-Left)**

## 4. Example / Analogy
üìö Like a **perfectly organized bookshelf** that **re-adjusts itself automatically** to stay evenly stacked and easy to access.

## 5. When to use it?
Use **AVL Trees** when you need:
- **Fast and consistent performance**  
- **Frequent insertions and deletions**  
- Efficient handling of **dynamic, sorted data**

## 6. Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Always balanced** ‚Üí guaranteed `O(log n)` operations
- **Efficient for dynamic data sets**

### ‚ùå Cons
- Slightly **more complex** than regular BSTs  
- **Extra rotations** add overhead

## 7. Related Concepts
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Red-Black Tree**
- **Rotations** (LL, RR, LR, RL)
- **Balance Factor**

## 8. Conclusion
**AVL Trees** are ideal when working with **ordered, dynamic data** where **inserts and deletes are frequent**.  
Thanks to their self-balancing nature, they **guarantee fast performance** and keep the tree from degrading like an unbalanced BST.

# Binary Tree vs BST vs AVL Tree Comparison

| **Aspect** | **BT (Binary Tree)** | **BST (Binary Search Tree)** | **AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Definition** | A tree where each node has at most two children | A binary tree with elements in left < root < right order | A BST that maintains balance by ensuring height difference ‚â§ 1 |
| **Structure Rule** | No ordering rule | Left child < Root < Right child | BST + Balance Factor (‚àí1, 0, 1) |
| **Balanced?** | Not necessarily | Not necessarily | Always balanced |
| **Search Time (Average)** | O(n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Search Time (Worst)** | O(n) | O(n) (if skewed) | O(log n) (guaranteed) |
| **Insertion/Deletion Time** | O(n) | O(log n) avg, O(n) worst | O(log n) always (due to rotations) |
| **Use Cases** | General tree structure, expression trees | Efficient searching/sorting | When fast and guaranteed O(log n) operations are needed |
| **Rotations?** | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (LL, RR, LR, RL) |

## Examples

### Binary Tree
Randomly built tree:
```
    A
   / \
  B   C
```

### BST (Binary Search Tree)
Maintains order:
```
    10
   /  \
  5    15
```

### AVL Tree
Balanced and ordered:
```
    10
   /  \
  5    15
```
with rebalancing if needed

## Summary

- **BT**: No ordering or balancing. Just a structure.
- **BST**: Ordered, but can become unbalanced.
- **AVL**: Ordered **and** balanced ‚Äî uses rotations to maintain performance.

# Anagrams

## 1. What is it?  
Anagrams are words or strings that contain the same characters in any order, with the same frequency.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It’s a common string problem used to test knowledge of hashing, sorting, and frequency counting in coding interviews.

## 3. How it works?  
You can sort both strings and compare, or use hash maps (dictionaries) to count character frequencies and match them.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
"listen" and "silent" are anagrams — same letters, just shuffled like the same ingredients in a different recipe.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use this concept in problems like:  
- Grouping anagrams  
- Detecting plagiarism  
- Solving string-matching challenges

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Simple logic with sorting or hashing.  
❌ Sorting takes O(n log n), and hash maps use extra space.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Hashing, frequency maps, sorting, sliding window, character arrays.

## 8. Conclusion  
Anagrams test your grasp of string manipulation and frequency analysis, and are key for mastering pattern-matching problems.

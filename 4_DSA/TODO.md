insertion sort
merge sort
collision and its handling
Heapify exact concept 
Do more practical using heap
how time and space complexity calculated
asynotations-worst case - which notation?
diff types of linked list and their differences.
explian binary search and merge sort and quick sort with complexity
best case time complexity of quicksort.
what is heapify explain with complexity
what is base case in recursion?
what is load factor, threshold value.
bt vs bst
avl tree
tree traversal - preorder - explanation
degree of node in graph
if we insert in  stack - in which position the element is inserted
if we delete in stack - position of element deleted.
(practical) - graph (question given 6 nodes and inter connected - dfs and bfs)
Theory:-

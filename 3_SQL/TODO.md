1️⃣ Basic SQL syntax: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.
2️⃣ Filtering data: Using WHERE with operators (=, <>, <, >, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE).
3️⃣ Sorting data: ORDER BY with ASC and DESC.
4️⃣ Aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX for data analysis.
5️⃣ GROUP BY and HAVING: Grouping data and filtering aggregated results.
6️⃣ Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
7️⃣ Subqueries: Writing nested queries inside SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses.
8️⃣ Creating and modifying tables: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE.
9️⃣ Inserting, updating, and deleting data: INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE.

Internal Level
Description:
This level is all about the physical storage of data — how the data is actually saved on the computer, like in files, blocks, memory, etc.
Seen By:
Only the database engine/system sees this. Humans (like users or developers) usually don’t interact with this level.
Conceptual Level
Description:
This level shows the logical structure of the entire database. It defines what tables exist, what columns are in them, what data types they use, and how the tables are related.
External Level
Description:
This level is what the end users see. It shows custom views based on the user's role or need. Each user may see only part of the database (not the full structure).

Theory:-
What is SQL?
What is a stored procedure?
What is a trigger?
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
What is atomicity?
What is SQL injection?
What is denormalization?
Practical:-
Find the customer names whose total spend is more than 12,000 –  Partially done
Show each customer’s total amount spent and total number of orders in a single row – Not done

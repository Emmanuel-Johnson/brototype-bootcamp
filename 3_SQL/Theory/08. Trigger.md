# Triggers 

## 1. What is it?  
A **trigger** in PostgreSQL is a special function that automatically executes in response to specific events like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on a table or view.

## 2. Why it matters?  
Triggers allow you to **enforce business rules**, **maintain audit logs**, or **automate backend tasks** — all without modifying your application code.

## 3. How it works  
- First, you define a **trigger function** (usually in `PL/pgSQL`, but can use other languages).  
- Then, bind it to a table using `CREATE TRIGGER`.  
- PostgreSQL runs the trigger function **automatically** when the specified event happens (like after a row is inserted).

## 4. Example / Analogy  
Like a **motion-sensor light**:  
- When motion is detected (e.g., someone inserts a row),  
- The light (trigger function) turns on automatically.

## 5. When to use it  
Use triggers when you want to:  
- Log changes to data (audit logging)  
- Enforce complex validations  
- Automatically update related tables  
- Prevent or restrict certain actions  

## 6. Pros and Cons  

**✅ Pros:**  
- Automates backend logic  
- Improves consistency and integrity  
- Reduces application-level duplication

**❌ Cons:**  
- Harder to debug  
- Can **impact performance** if overused  
- May lead to hidden logic (less transparent to developers)

## 7. Related Concepts  
- **Trigger Functions** (`RETURNS TRIGGER`)  
- `BEFORE` and `AFTER` events  
- **Stored Procedures**  
- **Constraints**  
- **Rules**

## 8. Conclusion  
Triggers in PostgreSQL are powerful tools for **automating database behavior**. When used wisely, they improve **data integrity** and reduce **manual work** — but overusing them can lead to performance and maintenance issues.

# TCL Commands 

## 1. What is it?  
TCL stands for **Transaction Control Language** — it includes SQL commands that manage transactions in a PostgreSQL database.

## 2. Why it matters?  
TCL ensures **data integrity** by allowing multiple operations to be treated as a **single atomic unit** — either everything succeeds or nothing is saved.

## 3. How it works?  
TCL commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` are used in PostgreSQL to control transaction boundaries.

- Transactions **start implicitly** in `psql` after DML statements, or explicitly using `BEGIN`.
- Changes are **not permanent** until `COMMIT` is issued.
- `ROLLBACK` cancels all changes in the current transaction.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like editing a document:  
- `SAVEPOINT` is a draft save  
- `COMMIT` is your final save  
- `ROLLBACK` is undoing to the last save or draft

## 5. When to use it?  
Use TCL in PostgreSQL when executing **multiple SQL operations** that must succeed or fail **together** — useful in **banking, order processing**, or **batch updates**.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Maintains consistency  
✅ Prevents partial updates  
✅ Offers control through `SAVEPOINT`  
❌ Nested transactions are not truly supported (workarounds via `SAVEPOINT`)  
❌ Can become complex in long transactions

## 7. Related Concepts  
- **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)  
- **DML** commands (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)  
- **Transaction isolation levels** (`READ COMMITTED`, `SERIALIZABLE`, etc.)

## 8. Conclusion  
PostgreSQL’s TCL commands are vital for **data reliability** and **safe operations**. They give you precise control to **commit**, **undo**, or **partially roll back** changes when needed.

## ✅ Common TCL Commands in PostgreSQL

| Command                      | Purpose                                         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `BEGIN`                      | Starts a new transaction                        |
| `COMMIT`                     | Saves all changes in the current transaction    |
| `ROLLBACK`                   | Reverts all changes since the transaction began |
| `SAVEPOINT save_name`        | Sets a named point to roll back to later        |
| `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT name` | Rolls back to a specific savepoint              |
| `RELEASE SAVEPOINT name`     | Removes a savepoint (no rollback after this)    |

> 🔹 In `psql`, you can also use `START TRANSACTION` instead of `BEGIN`.  
> 🔹 Transactions are **automatic** in many tools unless explicitly turned off.

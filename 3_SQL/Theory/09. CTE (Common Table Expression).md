# Common Table Expressions (CTE)

## 1. What is it?  
A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary, named result set defined using the `WITH` keyword. It can be referenced within a larger SQL query and behaves like a temporary view.

## 2. Why it matters?  
CTEs improve **query readability**, allow **reusability** of subqueries, and enable **recursive queries** in a clean and structured way.

## 3. How it works  
- Use the `WITH` keyword to define a CTE before your main query  
- You write the logic once and **refer to the CTE name** as if it were a table  
- It exists only **for the duration of that query**

## 4. Example / Analogy  
Like assigning a variable in programming:  
You define it once and use it multiple times instead of repeating the same code.

## 5. When to use it  
Use CTEs when:  
- Your query has **complex or repeated subqueries**  
- You want to **modularize** your SQL  
- You're writing **recursive queries**  
- You want to break up a large query into **logical chunks**

## 6. Pros and Cons  

**‚úÖ Pros:**  
- Improves code clarity and maintainability  
- Supports recursion  
- Helps structure long queries into logical steps

**‚ùå Cons:**  
- Might be **less optimized** in certain cases compared to derived tables  
- **Not cached** across queries (it‚Äôs temporary per execution)

## 7. Related Concepts  
- **Subqueries**  
- **Temporary tables**  
- **Recursive queries**  
- **Views**

## 8. Conclusion  
CTEs are a powerful feature in PostgreSQL for writing **clean**, **modular**, and **reusable** queries. They‚Äôre especially valuable for complex logic and recursive operations, making your SQL easier to write and maintain.

## üîπ Practical Example

```sql
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE is_active = true
)
SELECT * FROM active_users WHERE username ILIKE 'john%';
```

# 3-Schema Architecture in DBMS

## 1. What is it?
It’s a framework that separates a database system into three levels: internal, conceptual, and external, to manage data abstraction and independence.

## 2. Why it matters?
It allows changes in data storage or user views without affecting each other, improving maintainability and scalability.

## 3. How it works?
Each layer abstracts complexity:  
- **Internal** defines physical storage,  
- **Conceptual** defines logical structure,  
- **External** defines user-specific views.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a website:  
- Backend servers (internal),  
- Data models (conceptual),  
- The UI that users see (external).

## 5. When to use it?
Always — it's foundational in DBMS design to ensure clean separation between storage, logic, and user interaction.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ **Pros**: Data independence, security, modularity.  
❌ **Cons**: More complexity in DBMS design.

## 7. Related Concepts
Data Abstraction, Logical vs. Physical Schema, Views, Data Independence.

## 8. Conclusion
The 3-schema architecture promotes clean design by isolating physical storage, data logic, and user interfaces — crucial for robust database systems.

## 1. Internal Level
**The deep behind-the-scenes stuff**

This is how the table is stored inside PostgreSQL. It includes:
- How data is saved in files, blocks, and indexes
- Physical storage mechanisms
- Things we don't normally see or interact with directly

## 2. Conceptual Level
**The structure — what the database looks like**

This level defines:
- What tables exist
- What columns they have
- What data types are used
- How tables are connected (relationships)

## 3. External Level
**What the user sees — through queries or views**

Examples include:
- `SELECT * FROM users;`
- More restricted views: `SELECT name FROM users;`

The user doesn't know or care **how it's stored**, just what they see.

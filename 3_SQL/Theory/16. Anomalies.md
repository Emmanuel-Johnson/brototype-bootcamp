# Insertion Anomaly 

## 1. What is it?
Trouble inserting data because other data is missing.

## 2. Why it matters?
It exposes poor table design and redundancy, which can block adding valid data or lead to incorrect defaults.

## 3. How it works?
It happens in unnormalized tables — e.g., if student and course info are stored in one table, you can’t insert a new course unless a student enrolls.

## 4. Example/Analogy
You can’t add a new course to a student_courses table unless a student is also registered — because both student_name and course_name are stored together.

## 5. When to use it?
You don’t use it — you try to prevent it by applying proper normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

## 6. Pros and Cons
❌ Bad: Prevents legitimate data entry.  
✅ Solvable: Fixed with good schema design.

## 7. Related Concepts
Normalization, Functional dependency, Redundancy, 1NF–3NF

## 8. Conclusion
Insertion anomalies indicate the need for normalization — always aim to store each fact in the right table independently.

# Update Anomaly 

## 1. What is it?
An update anomaly happens when a change to data requires multiple rows to be updated, and inconsistencies can occur if not all are updated.

## 2. Why it matters?
It can lead to data inconsistency, especially when the same information is duplicated across rows.

## 3. How it works?
In poorly normalized tables, redundant data exists — so updating one instance but not others creates conflicting values.

## 4. Example/Analogy
A student's phone number is repeated in many rows. If it changes, you must update every occurrence. Missing one leads to inconsistency.

## 5. When to use it?
You don’t use it — it’s a symptom of a flawed schema and should be avoided.

## 6. Pros and Cons
❌ Risk of inconsistency, data corruption.  
✅ Solvable through normalization and separating repeated data.

## 7. Related Concepts
Redundancy, Normalization, Functional dependency, 2NF

## 8. Conclusion
Update anomalies are a warning sign of redundant design — fix them by applying proper normalization to reduce data duplication.

# Deletion Anomaly 

## 1. What is it?
A deletion anomaly occurs when deleting a record unintentionally causes the loss of important related data.

## 2. Why it matters?
It leads to accidental loss of valuable information due to poor table structure and dependency between unrelated data.

## 3. How it works?
In unnormalized tables, deleting one fact (e.g., a student’s enrollment) may also delete another fact (e.g., the course info) if both are in the same row.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If you remove the last student enrolled in a course, and that course info is only stored in that row, the course itself is lost.

## 5. When to use it?
You don’t — deletion anomalies are design flaws and should be avoided by separating concerns via normalization.

## 6. Pros and Cons
❌ Causes unintended data loss.  
✅ Solvable with normalized design (e.g., separate course and enrollment tables).

## 7. Related Concepts
Normalization, Functional dependency, Referential integrity, 1NF–3NF

## 8. Conclusion
Deletion anomalies highlight redundancy and poor separation of data — they can be prevented by using normalized relational models.

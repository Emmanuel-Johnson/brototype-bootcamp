# Prime vs Non-Prime Attribute in PostgreSQL

## ‚úÖ Prime Attribute
An attribute (column) that is part of any candidate key.

- Can be part of the primary key or any other candidate key.
- Plays a key role in normalization (especially 2NF and 3NF).

## ‚ùå Non-Prime Attribute
An attribute that is **not** part of any candidate key.

- Typically contains descriptive or dependent data.
- Used to identify partial and transitive dependencies in normalization.

# Functional Dependency in PostgreSQL

## ‚úÖ What is "functionally dependent"?
A column **B** is said to be functionally dependent on column **A** if:

> Knowing the value of **A** tells you exactly one value of **B**.

## üìå Example:
Consider this table:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1         | C101     | Alice       |
| 1         | C102     | Alice       |
| 2         | C101     | Bob         |

- The **composite primary key** is (`StudentID`, `CourseID`).
- But `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`, not on the full key.

So:

- `StudentName` is **functionally dependent** on `StudentID`.
- It is **not functionally dependent** on the entire composite key (`StudentID`, `CourseID`).
- This is a **partial dependency**, which **violates 2NF**.

## üéØ In Simple Terms:
**Functional Dependency** means:

> ‚ÄúOne value determines another.‚Äù

Notation:  
**A ‚Üí B** means:  
If you know **A**, you can find **B**  
(*but not necessarily the other way around*).

# Partial Dependency in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
A partial dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute depends on part of a composite primary key, not the whole key.

## 2. Why it matters?
It causes redundancy and can lead to data anomalies in database design.

## 3. How it works?
If a table has a composite key, and a column relies only on one part of that key, not the full key, that's a partial dependency.

## 4. Example/Analogy
In a student-course table:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1         | C101     | Alice       |
| 1         | C102     | Alice       |
| 2         | C101     | Bob         |

Here, the composite primary key is (`StudentID`, `CourseID`).  
But `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`, not the full key ‚Äî this is a **partial dependency**.

## 5. When to use it?
You identify and remove partial dependencies when moving a table from **1NF to 2NF** in normalization.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Removing them improves data integrity.  
‚ùå May increase the number of tables in your schema.

## 7. Related Concepts
Composite keys, 2NF, Functional dependency

## 8. Conclusion
Avoiding partial dependency is essential for a well-normalized, efficient database structure.

# Transitive Dependency in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
A transitive dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute, which in turn depends on the primary key.

## 2. Why it matters?
It leads to unnecessary dependencies and data redundancy, violating **3NF (Third Normal Form)**.

## 3. How it works?
If **A ‚Üí B** and **B ‚Üí C**, then **C** is **transitively dependent** on **A**.  
In a table, this means one non-key column indirectly depends on the primary key through another column.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If:

- `EmployeeID ‚Üí DepartmentID`, and  
- `DepartmentID ‚Üí DepartmentName`,  

then `DepartmentName` is **transitively dependent** on `EmployeeID`.

## 5. When to use it?
You remove transitive dependencies when converting a table from **2NF to 3NF** during normalization.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Eliminating them improves design and avoids update anomalies.  
‚ùå Can lead to more tables and joins in queries.

## 7. Related Concepts
3NF, Functional dependency, Normalization

## 8. Conclusion
Removing transitive dependencies helps create cleaner, more maintainable databases with fewer anomalies.

# Example of Transitive Dependency

## üéØ Table: Employees

| EmployeeID | Name    | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice   | D001         | HR             |
| 2          | Bob     | D002         | Finance        |
| 3          | Charlie | D001         | HR             |

## üîç What's happening?

- `EmployeeID ‚Üí DepartmentID` (Each employee belongs to one department)  
- `DepartmentID ‚Üí DepartmentName` (Each department has one name)

So:  
**EmployeeID ‚Üí DepartmentID ‚Üí DepartmentName**

This means:  
**`DepartmentName` is *transitively dependent* on `EmployeeID`**

## ‚úÖ Fix (To remove the transitive dependency):

**Split into two tables:**

### 1. Employees Table

| EmployeeID | Name    | DepartmentID |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice   | D001         |
| 2          | Bob     | D002         |
| 3          | Charlie | D001         |

### 2. Departments Table

| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|--------------|----------------|
| D001         | HR             |
| D002         | Finance        |

# Functional Dependency in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
A functional dependency occurs when one column uniquely determines another column's value.

## 2. Why it matters?
It forms the foundation for **normalization** and helps structure a reliable, consistent database.

## 3. How it works?
If column **A** determines column **B** (**A ‚Üí B**), then for every value of **A**, there is exactly one corresponding value of **B**.

## 4. Example/Analogy
In a student table:  
**StudentID ‚Üí StudentName**  
means each `StudentID` gives **exactly one** `StudentName`.

## 5. When to use it?
You use functional dependency when designing normalized tables and checking for **1NF, 2NF, 3NF**, etc.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Ensures consistency and clarity in relationships.  
‚ùå May require splitting tables, which can increase complexity.

## 7. Related Concepts
Normalization, Keys, Data integrity, Partial dependency, Transitive dependency

## 8. Conclusion
Functional dependency helps ensure data accuracy by clearly defining relationships between columns ‚Äî it's essential for clean, normalized design.

---

## ‚úÖ Simple Example in a Table

| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | Alice        |
| 2         | Bob          |

### Explanation:
**StudentID ‚Üí StudentName**  
Because knowing the `StudentID` gives you **exactly one** `StudentName`.

# Trivial Dependency in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
A trivial dependency is when a set of attributes functionally determines a subset of itself.

## 2. Why it matters?
It helps distinguish meaningful dependencies from obvious ones during normalization.

## 3. How it works?
If **A ‚Üí B** and **B is part of A**, then it‚Äôs trivial.  
Example: `{A, B} ‚Üí A` is trivial because **A** is already part of `{A, B}`.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Saying `{EmployeeID, Name} ‚Üí EmployeeID` is like saying ‚Äúyour full name tells your first name‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs obvious and always true.

## 5. When to use it?
Trivial dependencies are used in analyzing and simplifying functional dependencies during decomposition.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Easy to verify and always hold true.  
‚ùå Not useful for normalization ‚Äî they don‚Äôt reveal redundancy or anomalies.

## 7. Related Concepts
Non-trivial dependency, Functional dependency, Normalization rules

## 8. Conclusion
Trivial dependencies are always true and safe but don‚Äôt help identify design problems ‚Äî they‚Äôre mostly used for theoretical analysis.

## ‚úÖ Simple Example:

Let's say you have this dependency:

```
{StudentID, CourseID} ‚Üí StudentID
```

This is **trivial** because `StudentID` is already a part of `{StudentID, CourseID}`.

## üéØ Terminology: Determinant vs Dependent

- `{StudentID, CourseID}` is the **determinant**  
  ‚Üí The set of attributes on the **left side** of the functional dependency.

- `StudentID` is the **dependent**  
  ‚Üí The attribute on the **right side** of the functional dependency.

---

# Non-Trivial Functional Dependency in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
A non-trivial functional dependency is when an attribute depends on another set of attributes that does **not already contain it**.

## 2. Why it matters?
These are meaningful dependencies that affect table design and help identify normalization issues.

## 3. How it works?
If **A ‚Üí B** and **B is not part of A**, then it is a **non-trivial** functional dependency.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If `StudentID ‚Üí StudentName`, it's non-trivial because `StudentName` is **not** part of `StudentID`.

## 5. When to use it?
You focus on non-trivial dependencies during **normalization** to avoid redundancy and anomalies.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Helps optimize database design.  
‚ùå Can be complex to track all non-trivial FDs in large schemas.

## 7. Related Concepts
Trivial dependency, Functional dependency, Normalization, BCNF

## 8. Conclusion
Non-trivial dependencies are essential for identifying and fixing real data redundancy and design issues ‚Äî they guide you toward cleaner and more efficient schemas.

# Simple Example

## Table:
| StudentID | StudentName | Course |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1         | Alice       | Math   |

## Dependency: 
`StudentID ‚Üí StudentName`

* This is **non-trivial** because `StudentName` is not a part of `StudentID`.

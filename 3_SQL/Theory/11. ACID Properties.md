# ACID in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability ‚Äî four key properties that ensure reliable database transactions.

## 2. Why it matters?
It guarantees that even in the event of crashes, errors, or concurrent operations, your data stays accurate and reliable.

## 3. How it works?
PostgreSQL uses write-ahead logging (WAL), transaction management, and locking mechanisms to enforce each ACID principle during every transaction.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like booking a flight: either all steps (payment, seat assignment) succeed or none ‚Äî ensuring the booking is always valid and traceable.

## 5. When to use it?
Always ‚Äî especially in financial, inventory, and mission-critical applications where data integrity is essential.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ **Pros**: Strong data integrity and reliability.  
‚ùå **Cons**: Can add overhead and reduce performance in high-throughput systems.

## 7. Related Concepts
Transactions, Savepoints, WAL, MVCC, Isolation Levels, Rollbacks.

## 8. Conclusion
ACID ensures PostgreSQL transactions are safe, consistent, and recoverable ‚Äî making it a trusted choice for critical applications.

# üß† Quick Breakdown of ACID

| Property | Meaning | PostgreSQL Support |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Atomicity** | All steps of a transaction succeed or none do. | Achieved via `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`. |
| **Consistency** | Database stays in a valid state after transactions. | Enforced by constraints, triggers, rules. |
| **Isolation** | Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other. | Implemented via isolation levels (`READ COMMITTED`, `SERIALIZABLE`). |
| **Durability** | Once committed, data is never lost. | Handled by Write-Ahead Logging (WAL). |

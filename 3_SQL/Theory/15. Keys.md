# üîπ Primary Key 

## 1. What is it?
A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a PostgreSQL table.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate or NULL values in the key column(s).

## 3. How it works?
When a column is defined as PRIMARY KEY, PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique index on it and enforces uniqueness and non-null constraints.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a student roll number ‚Äî every student must have a unique number, and none can be blank.

## 5. When to use it?
Use it when you need to ensure each record in a table is uniquely and reliably identifiable.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Ensures uniqueness and non-nullity.  
‚ùå Can‚Äôt have multiple primary keys in one table; must choose wisely.

## 7. Related Concepts
Unique key, Foreign key, Composite key, Surrogate key, Candidate key

## 8. Conclusion
Primary keys are essential in relational design to uniquely identify records and maintain consistency in your PostgreSQL database.

# üîπ Composite Key 

## 1. What is it?
A composite key is a primary key made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a row.

## 2. Why it matters?
It allows you to uniquely identify records where a single column isn‚Äôt sufficient.

## 3. How it works?
PostgreSQL enforces uniqueness across the combination of specified columns using a `PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2)` definition.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a combination of a class ID and student roll number to uniquely identify a student across different classes.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when no single column can act as a unique identifier but a combination can.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Ensures multi-column uniqueness.  
‚ùå Can complicate joins and foreign key relationships.

## 7. Related Concepts
Primary key, Candidate key, Surrogate key, Foreign key

## 8. Conclusion
Composite keys are powerful tools when uniqueness depends on the combination of multiple columns in a PostgreSQL table.

# üîπ Natural Key 

## 1. What is it?
A natural key is a column or set of columns that naturally and uniquely identify a record using real-world data (not system-generated).

## 2. Why it matters?
It avoids adding artificial IDs by relying on existing meaningful attributes to maintain uniqueness.

## 3. How it works?
You define a PRIMARY KEY on one or more real-world fields like email, ISBN, or SSN to enforce uniqueness.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like using a person‚Äôs passport number as a key ‚Äî it's meaningful and unique.

## 5. When to use it?
When a real-world attribute is guaranteed to be unique, stable, and meaningful across the dataset.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Readable and meaningful.  
‚ùå Risk of change over time, wider indexes, and potential privacy issues.

## 7. Related Concepts
Surrogate key, Primary key, Candidate key

## 8. Conclusion
Natural keys tie your data model to real-world identifiers, but they must be chosen carefully to avoid future issues.

---

# üîπ Surrogate Key 

## 1. What is it?
A surrogate key is a system-generated, meaningless unique identifier (often an INTEGER or UUID) used as the primary key.

## 2. Why it matters?
It avoids relying on real-world attributes that might change, providing stability and simplicity.

## 3. How it works?
Typically implemented as `SERIAL`, `BIGSERIAL`, or `UUID` columns with a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like giving each employee an internal ID number instead of using their name or email.

## 5. When to use it?
When natural keys are unstable, too long, private, or not guaranteed to be unique.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Simple, immutable, no business logic tied to it.  
‚ùå Less meaningful for users and requires joins for context.

## 7. Related Concepts
Natural key, Primary key, Composite key, UUID

## 8. Conclusion
Surrogate keys are ideal for internal stability and database performance, especially when natural keys are unreliable or sensitive.

---

# üîπ Foreign Key 

## 1. What is it?
A foreign key is a column (or group of columns) that creates a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

## 2. Why it matters?
It enforces referential integrity, ensuring data across related tables stays consistent.

## 3. How it works?
When a foreign key is defined, PostgreSQL checks that the values in that column exist in the referenced table‚Äôs primary key.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a student table storing a `class_id` that points to the `id` in the class table ‚Äî ensuring the class exists.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when one table depends on data from another ‚Äî e.g., orders referencing customers.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Maintains data consistency.  
‚ùå Can restrict deletes/updates unless handled (e.g., with `ON DELETE CASCADE`).

## 7. Related Concepts
Primary key, Join, One-to-many relationship, Referential integrity

## 8. Conclusion
Foreign keys are essential for building relationships between tables and ensuring your database stays consistent and reliable.

---

# üîπ Candidate Key 

## 1. What is it?
A candidate key is any column (or set of columns) that can uniquely identify a row in a table ‚Äî all are eligible to become the primary key.

## 2. Why it matters?
It helps determine which fields can enforce uniqueness, allowing you to choose the best option for a primary key.

## 3. How it works?
PostgreSQL does not enforce a "candidate key" explicitly, but any unique and non-null column combination is a candidate.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like a person with multiple ID proofs (passport, driving license) ‚Äî all valid for identification, but only one is used officially.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when designing schema ‚Äî evaluate candidate keys to decide the most stable and meaningful one for `PRIMARY KEY`.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Flexibility in choosing keys.  
‚ùå Requires analysis to avoid choosing unstable or large fields.

## 7. Related Concepts
Primary key, Alternate key, Unique constraint, Natural key

## 8. Conclusion
Candidate keys are potential unique identifiers in a table, and the best one becomes the primary key ‚Äî the rest become alternate keys.

---

# üîπ Alternate Key 

## 1. What is it?
An alternate key is any candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key.

## 2. Why it matters?
It still uniquely identifies rows, and can be enforced using a `UNIQUE` constraint.

## 3. How it works?
PostgreSQL enforces alternate keys by adding `UNIQUE` constraints on the relevant column(s) not used as the primary key.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If a user has both an email and a username, and you choose email as the primary key, then username becomes the alternate key.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when you want to maintain uniqueness across multiple columns that could have been primary keys.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Adds flexibility and integrity.  
‚ùå May require extra indexes and complexity in constraint management.

## 7. Related Concepts
Candidate key, Primary key, Unique key, Natural key

## 8. Conclusion
Alternate keys are backup unique identifiers that help preserve data integrity and flexibility in relational schema design.

---

# üîπ Unique Key 

## 1. What is it?
A unique key is a column or set of columns that must have unique values across all rows in a table.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures that no two rows have the same value(s) in the specified column(s), maintaining data integrity.

## 3. How it works?
In PostgreSQL, the `UNIQUE` constraint is used to enforce this rule at the database level.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like ensuring email addresses are unique in a user table ‚Äî no duplicates allowed.

## 5. When to use it?
Use when a column must remain unique but doesn‚Äôt need to be the primary key ‚Äî e.g., usernames, emails, license numbers.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Prevents duplicates.  
‚ùå Allows `NULL` values (which can be multiple unless handled carefully).

## 7. Related Concepts
Primary key, Alternate key, Candidate key

## 8. Conclusion
Unique keys make sure that values in a column (or columns) are not repeated, even if they aren't the main key of the table.

---

# üîπ Super Key 

## 1. What is it?
A super key is any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table ‚Äî including the primary key and more.

## 2. Why it matters?
It forms the basis for identifying candidate keys and understanding functional dependencies.

## 3. How it works?
If a set of columns can uniquely identify every row, it's a super key ‚Äî even if it includes unnecessary columns.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If `employee_id` is unique, then `employee_id + email` is also a super key (though redundant).

## 5. When to use it?
Mostly used during database design and normalization to identify minimal keys (candidate keys).

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Useful for conceptual modeling.  
‚ùå May contain redundant columns and is not efficient for implementation.

## 7. Related Concepts
Candidate key, Primary key, Composite key, Functional dependency

## 8. Conclusion
Super keys help define all possible unique identifiers in a table, but only minimal ones become candidate keys or the primary key.

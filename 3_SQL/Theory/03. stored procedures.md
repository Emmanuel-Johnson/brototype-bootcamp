# ✅ STORED PROCEDURE in PostgreSQL

## Section: Answer

### 1. What is it?  
A stored procedure is a pre-written block of SQL code saved in the database. Instead of rewriting the same logic, you just call the procedure when you need it.

### 2. Why it matters?  
It allows logic to be executed close to the data, improving performance and keeping business logic centralized.

### 3. How it works?  
You define it using `CREATE PROCEDURE`, then execute it with `CALL procedure_name(args)` — it can include transactions, loops, and conditions.

### 4. Example/Analogy  
Like saving a recipe in the kitchen — you call it anytime instead of writing instructions from scratch each time.

### 5. When to use it?  
Use it when you need reusable logic with complex control flow (loops, conditions, transactions) inside the DB.

### 6. Pros and Cons  
- **Pros**: Reusable, fast, secure  
- **Cons**: Harder to version/control in code, can hide business logic in DB  

### 7. Related Concepts  
Functions, Triggers, Transactions, PL/pgSQL

### 8. Conclusion  
Stored procedures help encapsulate and automate complex database operations, boosting performance and reducing repetitive code.

# Normalization 

## 1. What is it?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## 2. Why it matters?
It ensures efficient storage, avoids data anomalies, and makes updates, deletions, and insertions more consistent.

## 3. How it works?
Data is broken into multiple related tables based on **functional dependencies** and **keys**, following normal forms like **1NF, 2NF, and 3NF**.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of breaking a flat Excel sheet into separate linked sheets for students, courses, and marks ‚Äî each storing only relevant data.

## 5. When to use it?
Use normalization when designing a **new database** or **refactoring an existing one** to improve performance and consistency.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Reduces redundancy, ensures accuracy  
‚ùå Can lead to more complex queries due to many joins

## 7. Related Concepts
Functional dependency, Primary key, Foreign key, Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

## 8. Conclusion
Normalization helps you design clean, efficient, and scalable databases that are easy to maintain and query.

# First Normal Form (1NF) 

## 1. What is it?
1NF ensures that each column in a table contains only **atomic (indivisible) values**, and each record is **unique**.

## 2. Why it matters?
It eliminates **repeating groups** and helps structure data into clear, simple rows and columns.

## 3. How it works?
You redesign tables so that **each cell holds only one value**  
(e.g., avoid storing comma-separated values like `"Math, English"` in a single column).

## 4. Example/Analogy
Instead of this:

| StudentID | Name  | Subjects         |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 1         | Alice | Math, English    |

You convert it into:

| StudentID | Name  | Subject  |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1         | Alice | Math     |
| 1         | Alice | English  |

## 5. When to use it?
**Always** use 1NF ‚Äî it‚Äôs the foundation of all normalized databases. Every table must meet this form to move to higher normal forms.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Makes data easier to filter, search, and manage  
‚ùå May increase the number of rows after removing multi-valued fields

## 7. Related Concepts
Atomic values, Repeating groups, Primary key, Flat file structure

## 8. Conclusion
1NF is the first step toward clean database design ‚Äî ensuring each field holds only one value and data is properly structured.

## üîç Scenario:

## ‚ùå Table **Before 1NF** (Unnormalized)

| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Alice | Math, English |
| 2 | Bob | Science, History |

**Problem:** The `Subjects` column contains **multiple values** (comma-separated), which violates 1NF.

## ‚úÖ Table **After 1NF** (Normalized)

| StudentID | StudentName | Subject |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Alice | Math |
| 1 | Alice | English |
| 2 | Bob | Science |
| 2 | Bob | History |

**Solution:** We **split multi-valued fields** into separate rows ‚Äî now each cell holds an atomic (single) value.

# Second Normal Form (2NF) 

## 1. What is it?
2NF ensures that every **non-prime attribute** is **fully functionally dependent** on the **entire primary key** ‚Äî not just a part of it.

## 2. Why it matters?
It removes **partial dependencies**, improving data structure when you have **composite primary keys**.

## 3. How it works?
Split the table so that **non-key attributes** depend only on the **full primary key**, not just a part of it.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Imagine an `Orders` table:

| OrderID | ProductID | CustomerName |
|---------|-----------|--------------|

If `OrderID + ProductID` is the composite primary key, but `CustomerName` depends only on `OrderID`,  
then that‚Äôs a **partial dependency** ‚Äî and it **violates 2NF**.

You fix it by splitting the data:

- One table for Order-Customer info  
- Another for Order-Product relationship

## 5. When to use it?
Use **2NF** after applying **1NF**, especially when dealing with **composite primary keys**.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Reduces redundancy and avoids partial updates  
‚ùå May increase the number of tables and complexity

## 7. Related Concepts
Composite key, Partial dependency, Prime/Non-prime attributes, Functional dependency

## 8. Conclusion
2NF helps remove **partial dependencies** by ensuring that all attributes relate to the **whole primary key** ‚Äî not just a part of it.

## üîç **Scenario: Table not in 2NF**

Suppose we have a table called `Student_Course`:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 101 | Alice | Math |
| 1 | 102 | Alice | English |
| 2 | 101 | Bob | Math |

Here, the **primary key** is a **composite key**: `(StudentID, CourseID)`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's the problem?

In this table:
- `StudentName` depends **only on** `StudentID`.
- `CourseName` depends **only on** `CourseID`.

So:
- `StudentName` is **partially dependent** on the primary key `(StudentID, CourseID)`.
- That **violates 2NF** because `StudentName` doesn't depend on the **entire** composite key ‚Äî just part of it.

## ‚úÖ How to fix it? (Make it 2NF)

We **decompose** the table into two (or more) tables, like this:

### 1. `Student` table:
| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Alice |
| 2 | Bob |

### 2. `Course` table:
| CourseID | CourseName |
|----------|------------|
| 101 | Math |
| 102 | English |

### 3. `Enrollment` table (junction table):
| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 101 |
| 1 | 102 |
| 2 | 101 |

Now, all non-key attributes in each table depend on the **entire** primary key ‚Äî and we're in **2NF** ‚úÖ.

## üìå So what does **"Student name is functionally dependent on student ID"** mean?

It means:
- If you know the `StudentID`, you can **uniquely determine** the `StudentName`.
- Formally: `StudentID ‚Üí StudentName` (functional dependency).

But since this dependency is **only on part** of the composite key `(StudentID, CourseID)`, it's a **partial dependency**, and that violates **2NF**.

## üîç Scenario:

## ‚ùå Before 3NF (Violates 3NF)

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DeptID | DeptName  |
|------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1          | Alice        | 10     | HR        |
| 2          | Bob          | 20     | Marketing |
| 3          | Charlie      | 10     | HR        |

**Problem:**
- `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, and `DeptID` depends on `EmployeeID`
- So `DeptName` has a **transitive dependency** on `EmployeeID`

## ‚úÖ After 3NF (Normalized)

### Employees Table
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DeptID |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1          | Alice        | 10     |
| 2          | Bob          | 20     |
| 3          | Charlie      | 10     |

### Departments Table
| DeptID | DeptName  |
|--------|-----------|
| 10     | HR        |
| 20     | Marketing |

**Solution:**
- Now, `DeptName` is stored in its own table and no longer depends indirectly on `EmployeeID`
- This eliminates the transitive dependency and satisfies 3NF requirements

# Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) 

## 1. What is it?
BCNF is a **stronger version of 3NF** where **every determinant is a candidate key**.

## 2. Why it matters?
It removes anomalies caused by dependencies on attributes that are **not true candidate keys**, which 3NF might not fully eliminate.

## 3. How it works?
If a **non-candidate key** determines another attribute, you **split the table** so that **each determinant** becomes a **candidate key** in a separate table.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Suppose a professor teaches only one subject, but multiple professors can teach the same subject:

| Professor | Subject | Room |
|-----------|---------|------|

If `Subject ‚Üí Room`, but `Professor ‚Üí Subject`,  
then `Room` is **functionally dependent** on `Professor` through `Subject`.

‚úÖ Fix: Decompose the table into:

- A table for `Professor ‚Üí Subject`  
- Another for `Subject ‚Üí Room`

## 5. When to use it?
Apply **BCNF** when even after **3NF**, you still find anomalies due to **non-trivial dependencies** on non-candidate keys.

## 6. Pros and Cons
‚úÖ Eliminates all redundancy from functional dependencies  
‚ùå May lead to more complex joins and multiple table references

## 7. Related Concepts
Functional dependency, Candidate key, 3NF, Determinant

## 8. Conclusion
**BCNF** ensures that **all functional dependencies are on candidate keys only**, eliminating subtle redundancy and improving design integrity.

## üîç Scenario:

## ‚ùå Before BCNF (Violates BCNF)

| Course  | Instructor | Room |
|---------|------------|------|
| Math    | Dr. John   | 101  |
| Physics | Dr. John   | 101  |
| Math    | Dr. Mike   | 102  |

**Assumptions:**
- A **room** can be assigned to only **one instructor**
- But an **instructor** can teach **multiple courses**

**Problem:**
- `Room ‚Üí Instructor` (Room determines Instructor)
- But `Room` is **not a candidate key** ‚Üí violates BCNF

## ‚úÖ After BCNF (Normalized)

### RoomAssignments Table
| Room | Instructor |
|------|------------|
| 101  | Dr. John   |
| 102  | Dr. Mike   |

### CourseAssignments Table
| Course  | Instructor |
|---------|------------|
| Math    | Dr. John   |
| Physics | Dr. John   |
| Math    | Dr. Mike   |

**Solution:**
- Now, each dependency is on a **candidate key**
- This eliminates the BCNF violation by separating the room-instructor dependency

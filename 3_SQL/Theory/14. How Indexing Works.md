# Indexes in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?
An index in PostgreSQL is a database structure that speeds up data retrieval by allowing faster lookup of rows.

## 2. Why it matters?
Without indexes, PostgreSQL scans the entire table (sequential scan) for every query — which is slow for large datasets.

## 3. How it works?
PostgreSQL creates index structures (like B-trees) on columns; when you query indexed columns, it uses the index to quickly find matching rows.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like an index in a book — instead of reading every page, you jump directly to the topic you need.

## 5. When to use it?
When querying large tables using `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY` on specific columns frequently.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ **Pros**: Faster read queries.  
❌ **Cons**: Slower writes and more storage used, especially with too many or unnecessary indexes.

## 7. Related Concepts

## 8. Conclusion
Indexes dramatically improve query performance in PostgreSQL, but should be used strategically to balance speed, storage, and write overhead.

## How It Works in PostgreSQL

When you create an index on a column (like `name`), PostgreSQL builds a special data structure — usually a **B-tree** — to store the values in **sorted order** along with pointers to the actual rows.

So instead of scanning the whole table, PostgreSQL:

1. **Looks in the index**  
2. **Finds the value quickly**  
3. **Jumps directly to the matching row** in the table

This significantly reduces the time it takes to retrieve data, especially in large tables.

## Practical Example

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT
);
```

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users(name);
```

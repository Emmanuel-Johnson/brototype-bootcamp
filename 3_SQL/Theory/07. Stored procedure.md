# Stored Procedures

## 1. What is it?  
A **stored procedure** in PostgreSQL is a reusable set of SQL statements stored in the database that can include logic, accept parameters, and control transactions.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It lets you move **business logic to the database layer**, reduce code duplication, and programmatically control transactions.

## 3. How it works?  
You define it using `CREATE PROCEDURE`, write the logic in **PL/pgSQL** or another supported language, and execute it using the `CALL` command.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a **saved function in a calculator** ‚Äî call it anytime with different inputs, and it gives consistent output with side effects like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use stored procedures when you need **reusable database operations** that may include **complex logic** and **transaction control**.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
‚úÖ Better performance  
‚úÖ Reusability  
‚úÖ Security  
‚ùå Harder to debug than application code  
‚ùå Complex logic can clutter the DB layer

## 7. Related Concepts  
- `CREATE FUNCTION` (Stored functions)  
- Triggers  
- `PL/pgSQL`  
- Transactions

## 8. Conclusion  
Stored procedures in PostgreSQL are **powerful tools** for encapsulating database logic and managing transactions with **clean, reusable code**.

## üîπ Practical Example

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE insert_user(name TEXT, age INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO users (username, age) VALUES (name, age);
END;
$$;
```

```sql
CALL insert_user('john_doe', 25);
```

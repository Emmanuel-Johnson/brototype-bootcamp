# NoSQL Databases

## 1. What is it?
NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for flexible, scalable, and high-performance data storage.

## 2. Why it matters?
They handle unstructured or semi-structured data, scale horizontally, and support modern applications like real-time analytics or distributed systems.

## 3. How it works?
Instead of fixed schemas, NoSQL databases use flexible formats like JSON, key-value pairs, or graphs to store data across distributed nodes.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of a traditional SQL table as a spreadsheet, while NoSQL can be like a folder with various file types inside — each formatted differently.

## 5. When to use it?
When dealing with big data, real-time apps, dynamic schemas, or massive scalability — such as social media platforms or IoT data.

## 6. Pros and Cons
✅ **Pros**: Highly scalable, flexible schema, fast for specific use cases.  
❌ **Cons**: Weaker consistency, limited support for complex joins.

## 7. Related Concepts
CAP Theorem, Sharding, ACID vs. BASE, Horizontal Scaling, Data Modeling.

## 8. Conclusion
NoSQL isn’t one-size-fits-all; understanding its types helps choose the right tool based on your data structure and application needs.

# NoSQL Database Types Guide

## 🧠 1. Document Stores
* **Structure**: Data is stored as documents (usually JSON, BSON, or XML).
* **Best For**: Semi-structured data like user profiles, content management, product catalogs.
* **Key Features**: Schema-less, flexible, nested fields.
* **Examples**: MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase Firestore

### 🧾 Example (MongoDB document):
```json
{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "orders": [123, 456] }
```

## 🔑 2. Key-Value Stores
* **Structure**: Simple key-value pairs (like a Python dictionary).
* **Best For**: Caching, session storage, quick lookups.
* **Key Features**: Extremely fast reads/writes.
* **Examples**: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak

### 🗝️ Example:
```
"session_id_abc123" → "user_data_here"
```

## 🧮 3. Column-Family Stores
* **Structure**: Data is stored in columns instead of rows (like a spreadsheet transposed).
* **Best For**: Large-scale analytics, time-series data.
* **Key Features**: Fast reads for wide datasets, great for aggregation.
* **Examples**: Apache Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB

### 🧱 Example:
```
UserID | Name  | Email           | Age
1001   | Alice | alice@mail.com  | 25
```
(But stored internally in columns, not rows)

## 🌐 4. Graph Databases
* **Structure**: Nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).
* **Best For**: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection.
* **Key Features**: Optimized for relationship queries.
* **Examples**: Neo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune

### 🔗 Example:
```
(Alice) -[FRIEND]-> (Bob)
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Type | Best For | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| Document Store | Semi-structured data | MongoDB, CouchDB |
| Key-Value Store | Caching, fast lookup | Redis, DynamoDB |
| Column-Family Store | Big data analytics | Cassandra, HBase |
| Graph Database | Relationships and connections | Neo4j, ArangoDB |

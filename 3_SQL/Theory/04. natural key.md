# Natural Key

## 1. What is it?  
A **natural key** is a column that already exists in your real-world data and can uniquely identify each row (such as an email, passport number, or username).

## 2. Why it matters  
Natural keys let you use meaningful data (instead of random IDs) to identify records, making databases easier to understand.

## 3. How it works  
In PostgreSQL, you can set a column like `email` or `roll_number` as a primary key or add a unique constraint to ensure no duplicates are allowed.

## 4. Example / Analogy  
Think of using a passport number to find a person â€” itâ€™s unique and real, so you donâ€™t need a made-up number.

## 5. When to use it  
Use a natural key if the column is always unique and wonâ€™t change â€” like an email, VIN number, or ISBN.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
**Pros:**  
- Easy to read and understand  
- Saves space

**Cons:**  
- Can cause problems if the data changes  
- May be problematic if the key is long or has many parts

## 7. Related Concepts  
- Surrogate Key (like an auto-increment ID)  
- Primary Key  
- Unique Constraint  
- Composite Key

## 8. Conclusion  
Natural keys work well when the data is clean, unique, and stable. But be careful â€” changing real data thatâ€™s used as a key can create issues later.

## Practical Examples

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Natural Key with Email

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,  -- using natural key
    name VARCHAR(100),
    password TEXT
);
```

âœ… Here, email is used as the natural key because it's:

- Unique

- Meaningful

- Already part of the data

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Surrogate Key (for comparison)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- using surrogate key
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    password TEXT
);
```
âœ… Here, id is a surrogate key:

- Auto-generated

- Has no real-world meaning

- Used only inside the database

# 🔑 Natural Key in PostgreSQL

## 1. What is it?  
A **natural key** is a column that already exists in your real-world data and can uniquely identify each row — such as an **email**, **passport number**, or **username**.

## 2. Why it matters  
Natural keys allow you to use **meaningful data** (instead of artificial IDs) to identify records, making the database **more intuitive** and easier to interpret.

## 3. How it works  
In PostgreSQL, you can set a natural key as a `PRIMARY KEY` or apply a `UNIQUE` constraint to ensure no duplicates are stored.

## 4. Example / Analogy  
Think of using a **passport number** to find a person — it’s unique and real, so there’s no need to assign an artificial number.

## 5. When to use it  
Use a natural key when the column is:  
- **Always unique**  
- **Stable (won’t change over time)**  
- **Meaningful** (like email, VIN number, ISBN, etc.)

## 6. Pros and Cons  

**✅ Pros:**  
- Easy to read and understand  
- Reduces redundancy (no extra ID column)

**❌ Cons:**  
- Can break if the natural data changes  
- Not ideal if the key is long or has multiple fields  
- Less flexible in relationships (especially for foreign keys)

## 7. Related Concepts  
- **Surrogate Key** (e.g., `SERIAL`, `UUID`)  
- **Primary Key**  
- **Unique Constraint**  
- **Composite Key**

## 8. Conclusion  
Natural keys are great when your data is **clean**, **unique**, and **unlikely to change**. But if you expect changes or complexity, surrogate keys may be safer.

# Practical Example

### 🔹 1. Using a Natural Key (Email)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Natural key
    name VARCHAR(100),
    password TEXT
);
```

## 🔹 2. Using a Surrogate Key (ID)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- Surrogate key
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    password TEXT
);
```

💡 id is auto-generated and has no real-world meaning — it’s just used inside the system.

## 🔹 3. Using a Composite Natural Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_code VARCHAR(10),
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_code)  -- Composite key
);
```

💡 Here, the combination of student_id and course_code uniquely identifies each enrollment.

# UNION 

## 1. What is it?  
**UNION** is a SQL operator in PostgreSQL that combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set ‚Äî removing **duplicate rows** by default.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows you to **merge data** from multiple sources with the **same structure**, which is especially useful when retrieving **similar or related data** stored in separate tables.

## 3. How it works?  
- PostgreSQL runs each `SELECT` query independently  
- It then **stacks the results vertically**  
- By default, duplicate rows are **removed**  
- Use `UNION ALL` to **include duplicates**

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Imagine two Excel sheets with the same columns:  
- `UNION` combines all rows into one sheet  
- But it **removes any duplicates**  
- `UNION ALL` keeps **all rows**, even duplicates

## 5. When to use it?  
Use `UNION` when:  
- The result sets have the **same number of columns**  
- Column **data types are compatible**  
- You want a **clean, deduplicated** result  
- You need to merge datasets from different time periods, tables, or sources

## 6. Pros and Cons  

**‚úÖ Pros:**  
- Easy to combine data  
- Deduplicates automatically  
- Keeps queries readable

**‚ùå Cons:**  
- Deduplication can impact performance  
- All `SELECT` queries must have the **same number and type of columns**  
- No control over duplicate handling unless you use `UNION ALL`

## 7. Related Concepts  
- `UNION ALL` ‚Üí includes duplicates  
- `JOIN` ‚Üí merges data horizontally based on keys  
- `INTERSECT` ‚Üí returns rows common to both queries  
- `EXCEPT` ‚Üí returns rows in the first query not in the second

## 8. Conclusion  
`UNION` is a great SQL tool when combining similar query results. It's best for producing **a clean, merged dataset** without duplicates ‚Äî perfect for **reporting**, **archiving**, or **summary views**.

## üîπ Practical Example 

Let‚Äôs say you have two tables: `students_2024` and `alumni`, both having compatible structures.

## Table Structures:
```sql
-- students_2024
CREATE TABLE students_2024 (
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT
);

-- alumni
CREATE TABLE alumni (
    full_name TEXT,
    contact TEXT
);
```
## Query using UNION:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM students_2024
UNION
SELECT full_name, contact FROM alumni;
```

‚úÖ This query merges both datasets and removes duplicates automatically.

## If you want to keep duplicates:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM students_2024
UNION ALL
SELECT full_name, contact FROM alumni;
```

üí° Use UNION ALL when you care about performance or want to preserve all entries, including duplicates.

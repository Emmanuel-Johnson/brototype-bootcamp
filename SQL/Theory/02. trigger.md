# ✅ TRIGGER in PostgreSQL

## Section: Answer

### 1. What is it?  
A trigger is a database callback function that automatically runs when a specific event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs on a table.

### 2. Why it matters?  
It helps enforce rules, automate actions (like logging or validation), and maintain data integrity without changing application logic.

### 3. How it works?  
You define a trigger function, then link it to a table and an event using `CREATE TRIGGER`; PostgreSQL then runs it when that event happens.

### 4. Example/Analogy  
Like setting a trap — when someone opens a door (insert/update/delete), it automatically activates a reaction (like ringing a bell).

### 5. When to use it?  
Use when you need automatic side-effects like history tracking, audit logs, or enforcing business rules at the DB level.

### 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Automatic, consistent logic enforcement  
- ❌ Can be hard to debug, may impact performance if overused.

### 7. Related Concepts  
Stored Procedures, Constraints, Views, Event Listeners

### 8. Conclusion  
Triggers let you embed reactive behavior directly into your database, ensuring key actions happen automatically and reliably.

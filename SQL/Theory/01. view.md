# ✅ VIEW 

## Section: Answer

### 1. What is it?  
A VIEW in PostgreSQL is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL SELECT query.

### 2. Why it matters?  
It helps simplify complex queries, improve reusability, and enhance security by exposing only selected data.

### 3. How it works?  
You define a view using `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...`, and then you can query it like a regular table.

### 4. Example/Analogy  
Think of a movie playlist on a streaming app. The actual movies are stored in one big library (the main table), but the playlist (the view) just shows a selection — like “Top 10 Action Movies.

### 5. When to use it?  
Use it when you need to reuse complex joins/filters, or want to restrict user access to sensitive data.

### 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Easy reuse, improved readability, better access control  
- ❌ Cannot always update directly, may affect performance if overused

### 7. Related Concepts  
Materialized Views, Subqueries, Permissions, Query Optimization

### 8. Conclusion  
Views help abstract and protect database logic, making SQL development cleaner and safer.

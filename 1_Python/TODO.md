list vs tuple
lambda function exact concept
list comprehension concept
decorators concept
do more practical
under the concept well and improve explanation well
Constructor vs destructor
list vs tuple
oops
class method vs static method
use of else in exception
how many arguments can be passed to lambda function
GIL 
generators
.iterators
use of with stmt 
match
deep copy and shallow copy  
Create a decorator with args
create a generator to count upto n

Theory:-
What is the use of the with statement?
What are context managers?
What is the use of @property?
Practical:-
Create a decorator that can access arguments –  Done
Generator for infinite Fibonacci series –  Done
Create a Floyd’s triangle pattern –  Partially done
Set chars
deepcopy() and copy() exact concept
decorator exact concept
difference between del and remove()
difference between staticmethod and classmethod
Decorators
mandatory module in package
use of else in exception
class method vs static method
generator vs iterator

MRO
context managers
types of arguments - needs improvement
Write a decorator for handling zero division error
create a new list with even negative numbers using list comprehension.

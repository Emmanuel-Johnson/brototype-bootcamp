# Thread

## 1. What is it?  
A thread in Python is a lightweight unit of execution within a single process, managed via the `threading` module.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It enables concurrent execution, helping Python programs handle multiple I/O operations like file access or API calls without blocking.

## 3. How it works?  
Threads share the same memory space and are scheduled by the OS, but Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a single chef preparing multiple dishes by switching between them quickly — efficient for tasks that involve waiting (e.g., boiling water).

## 5. When to use it?  
Use threads for I/O-bound tasks where most time is spent waiting (e.g., downloading files, handling requests).

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Easy to use, good for I/O-bound work, shared memory.  
- ❌ GIL restricts parallelism in CPU-bound tasks, risk of race conditions.

## 7. Related Concepts  
- GIL  
- Multiprocessing  
- Asyncio  
- `concurrent.futures`  
- Race conditions  

## 8. Conclusion  
Python threads are best for I/O-bound operations due to the GIL; for CPU-heavy tasks, multiprocessing is a better fit.

# Process

## 1. What is it?
A process is an independent program with its own memory space and system resources.

## 2. Why it matters 
Processes can run truly in parallel on multiple CPU cores, enabling real multitasking.

## 3. How it works
In Python, the `multiprocessing` module is used to create and manage processes.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like two separate computers working independently on different tasks.

## 5. When to use it 
When tasks are CPU-bound (e.g., calculations, simulations) and need true parallelism.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ‚úÖ True parallelism, avoids GIL  
- ‚ùå Higher memory and startup overhead, slower inter-process communication

## 7. Related Concepts
Threading, GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), Concurrency, Multiprocessing

## 8. Conclusion
Processes are ideal for heavy computations requiring full CPU utilization without Python‚Äôs GIL limits.

# Threads

## 1. What is it?
A thread is a lightweight sub-task within a process that shares memory with other threads of the same process.

## 2. Why it matters
Threads are useful for concurrent tasks like I/O operations or UI responsiveness.

## 3. How it works
Python's `threading` module allows creating multiple threads inside a single process.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like multiple people working on different parts of the same project in one room.

## 5. When to use it
When tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., file reading, network requests) and benefit from concurrency.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ‚úÖ Lightweight, faster to start  
- ‚ùå Affected by GIL, can‚Äôt run Python bytecode in parallel

## 7. Related Concepts
Multiprocessing, AsyncIO, Concurrency, GIL

## 8. Conclusion
Threads help handle I/O tasks concurrently but don‚Äôt offer true parallelism due to the GIL in CPython.

## üîπ Practical Example

### Using multiprocessing

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def show():
    print("Process running")

p = Process(target=show)
p.start()
p.join()
```

### Using threading

```python
from threading import Thread

def show():
    print("Thread running")

t = Thread(target=show)
t.start()
t.join()
```

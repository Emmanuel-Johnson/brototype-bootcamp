# Method Resolution Order (MRO)

## What is MRO?
MRO defines the order in which Python searches for a method or attribute when multiple inheritance is involved.

## Why does MRO matter?
It ensures consistent and predictable behavior when classes inherit from multiple parent classes.

## How does MRO work?
Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to compute a consistent method lookup order.

## Example or Analogy
Think of it like a queue of teachers‚ÄîPython checks one by one who can answer your question, following a fixed path.

## When should you use MRO?
It is crucial when designing or debugging classes with multiple inheritance to avoid ambiguity.

## Pros and Cons of MRO
- **Pros**: ‚úÖ Prevents ambiguity and cyclic inheritance issues.
- **Cons**: ‚ùå Can be confusing in deep hierarchies.

## Related Concepts
Inheritance, `super()`, C3 Linearization, `__mro__` attribute.

## Conclusion
MRO helps Python decide where to look first for methods, ensuring complex inheritance works safely and consistently.

## Practical Examples

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

obj = D()
obj.show()
print(D.__mro__)
```

### üîç Output:
```
B
(<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
```

### üîÅ Explanation:
- `D()` calls the `show()` method.
- Python looks in `D`, doesn't find it.
- Then looks in `B` (first parent), finds it.
- So "B" is printed.
- The `__mro__` tuple shows the method resolution order: `D ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A ‚Üí object`.

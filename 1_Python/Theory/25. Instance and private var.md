# Instance and Private Variables

## 1. What is it?  
An **instance variable** is a variable defined inside a class method and is unique to each object (instance) of the class.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows each object to maintain its own state, separate from other objects.

## 3. How it works?  
Instance variables are defined using `self`, for example:  
```python
self.name = "Alice"
```
inside `__init__`. They are stored in each object’s `__dict__`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Think of students in a class—each student (instance) has their own name, ID, etc. (instance variables).

## 5. When to use it?  
Use instance variables when you want every object to have its own copy of a variable.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Encapsulates object state  
- ❌ Too many instance variables can make class design messy

## 7. Related Concepts  
- Class variables  
- `__init__`  
- Encapsulation

## 8. Conclusion  
Instance variables store unique data for each object and are fundamental in OOP design.

# Private Variables

## 1. What is it?  
A **private variable** is intended to be inaccessible from outside the class directly, marked with a double underscore prefix (e.g., `__var`).

## 2. Why it matters?  
It helps protect internal class data from being changed or misused externally.

## 3. How it works?  
Python uses *name mangling*, changing `__var` to `_ClassName__var` to restrict direct access from outside the class.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like a PIN in a debit card—hidden from direct access and only usable through a secure method.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use private variables when you want to enforce restricted access to certain internal variables or logic.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Encourages safe design  
- ❌ Still accessible via name mangling, so not fully private

## 7. Related Concepts  
- Encapsulation  
- Protected variables (`_var`)  
- Property decorators

## 8. Conclusion  
Private variables help enforce internal control and abstraction, even though Python's privacy is by convention.

# Creating and Removing a File

## Creating a File

To create a file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the `"x"` mode, which creates a new file and opens it for writing.

```python
try:
    with open("new_file.txt", "x") as f:
        f.write("This is a new file.")
    print("File created successfully.")
except FileExistsError:
    print("File already exists.")
```

## Removing a File

To remove a file, you can use the `os.remove()` function. First, you need to import the `os` module. It is recommended to check if the file exists before attempting to delete it, to avoid errors.

```python
import os

file_path = "new_file.txt"

if os.path.exists(file_path):
    os.remove(file_path)
    print("File removed successfully.")
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```
## Python File Modes and Their Use Cases

| Mode  | Meaning         | Use Case / Description                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"r"` | Read (default)  | Open a file for reading only. File must exist.                                          |
| `"w"` | Write           | Create a new file or overwrite an existing file. Use for writing fresh data.           |
| `"x"` | Create          | Create a new file; fails if file exists. Safe way to avoid overwriting.                |
| `"a"` | Append          | Open file to append data at the end. Creates file if it doesn't exist.                 |
| `"r+"`| Read and write  | Open file for both reading and writing. File must exist.                               |
| `"w+"`| Write and read  | Open file for reading and writing; overwrites existing file or creates new.            |
| `"a+"`| Append and read | Open file for reading and appending. Creates file if it doesn't exist.                 |

### Additional Notes

**Text mode (default) vs Binary mode:**

- Adding `"b"` (e.g., `"rb"`, `"wb"`) opens the file in binary mode (for images, audio files, video files, PDFs, etc.).
- Adding `"t"` (e.g., `"rt"`, `"wt"`) opens the file in text mode (default if not specified).

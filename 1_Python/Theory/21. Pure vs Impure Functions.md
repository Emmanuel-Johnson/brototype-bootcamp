# Pure vs Impure Functions

## 1. What is it?
- **Pure function:** Always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
- **Impure function:** May change or depend on external state.

## 2. Why it matters
- **Pure functions:** Predictable, easier to test, debug, and parallelize.
- **Impure functions:** Can cause unexpected behavior.

## 3. How it works
- **Pure functions:** Don‚Äôt modify anything outside their scope.
- **Impure functions:** Might read/write files, update variables, or rely on randomness.

## 4. Example / Analogy
- **Pure:** Like a vending machine‚Äîinsert money, get the same snack every time.
- **Impure:** Like asking someone‚Äôs mood‚Äîit can change each time.

## 5. When to use it
- Use **pure functions** for logic-heavy parts.
- Use **impure functions** when side effects are necessary (e.g., saving data, printing output).

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ‚úÖ **Pure:** Easy to test, reusable.
- ‚ùå **Impure:** Harder to debug, but often necessary in real-world apps.

## 7. Related Concepts
- Functional programming
- Side effects
- Determinism
- Referential transparency

## 8. Conclusion
Aim for pure functions when possible‚Äîthey bring reliability and clarity. Use impure functions responsibly when interaction with the outside world is needed.

## üîπ Practical Examples

### Pure Function

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Impure Function

```python
def add_and_log(a, b):
    result = a + b
    print(f"Sum: {result}")  # Side effect: print
    return result
```

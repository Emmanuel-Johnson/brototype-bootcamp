# Context Managers

## 1. What is it?  
A context manager is a construct that manages resources by handling setup and cleanup automatically using the `with` statement.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It ensures that resources like files or connections are properly closed, even if an error occurs.

## 3. How it works?  
It uses `__enter__` to set up and `__exit__` to clean up, triggered by the `with` block.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like borrowing a library book — you check it out (`enter`), use it, and return it (`exit`) automatically.

## 5. When to use it?  
When working with files, database connections, threads, or any resource needing cleanup.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Clean, safe, and error-resistant.  
- ❌ Custom ones require understanding special methods.

## 7. Related Concepts  
- Try-finally blocks  
- Resource management  
- Decorators  

## 8. Conclusion  
Context managers simplify resource handling and make code more robust and readable.

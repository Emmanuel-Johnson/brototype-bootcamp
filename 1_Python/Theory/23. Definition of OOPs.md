# Definition of OOPs

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." In Python, objects are instances of classes that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP is designed to make code more modular, reusable, and easier to manage, especially in large and complex applications.

## Core Principles of OOP in Python

### Classes
Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. They define the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that the objects will have.

### Objects
Objects are individual instances of classes. Each object can hold unique values for its attributes and can perform actions defined by its class methods.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods within a class and restricting direct access to some components. This helps protect the internal state of objects and promotes controlled interaction.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (known as a child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This encourages code reuse and supports hierarchical relationships.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism enables different classes to define methods with the same name, which can be used interchangeably. This allows for flexibility in code that works with objects of different types through a common interface.

### Abstraction
Abstraction hides the complex internal workings of a class and exposes only what is necessary for the user. It simplifies how objects are interacted with by presenting a clean and understandable interface.

## Why Use OOP in Python?
OOP helps organize code into self-contained units, making it more understandable, scalable, and maintainable. Python's syntax and dynamic nature make implementing OOP concepts intuitive and powerful for developers.

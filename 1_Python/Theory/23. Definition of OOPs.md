# Definition of OOPs

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Python enables OOP by allowing you to define classes and create objects, promoting modular and reusable code.

## Core Concepts of OOP in Python

### Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods common to all instances.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.color} {self.brand} is driving.")
```

### Object
An object is an instance of a class.

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Red")
my_car.drive()  # Output: Red Toyota is driving.
```

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and requires all interaction to be performed through methods. This is often done using private attributes (with `_` or `__` prefix).

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def charge(self):
        print("Charging electric car.")
```

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism lets different classes implement the same method in different ways.

```python
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

def make_sound(animal):
    animal.sound()

make_sound(Dog())
make_sound(Cat())
```

### Abstraction
Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary features. In Python, this is typically achieved using abstract classes (with the `abc` module).

## Summary

OOP in Python helps organize code into reusable and logical structures, making it easier to maintain, scale, and understand. It emphasizes the DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and models real-world entities effectively.

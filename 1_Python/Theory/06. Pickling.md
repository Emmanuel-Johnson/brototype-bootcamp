# Pickling

## 1. What is it?  
Pickling is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows you to save Python objects to files or send them across a network while preserving their structure.

## 3. How it works?  
The `pickle` module serializes the object into bytes (`dump`/`dumps`) and can later deserialize it back (`load`/`loads`).

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like zipping a folder to send it via email, pickling "packages" the object to store or share it.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use it when you need to persist complex Python objects (e.g., dictionaries, lists, class instances) between sessions.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Easy to use and native to Python.  
- ❌ Not secure with untrusted sources; not cross-language compatible.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Serialization, JSON, `marshal`, `shelve`, object persistence.

## 8. Conclusion  
Pickling is a powerful way to serialize Python objects, ideal for saving and restoring program state — with caution about security.

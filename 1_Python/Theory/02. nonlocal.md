# nonlocal 

## 1. What is it?  
`nonlocal` is a Python keyword used to modify a variable in an enclosing scope, but not in the global scope.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows inner functions to update variables defined in their outer (enclosing) functions, which is crucial for closures and nested function logic.

## 3. How it works?  
When you declare a variable as `nonlocal`, Python looks for it in the nearest enclosing scope (excluding the global one) and binds changes to that variable instead of creating a new local copy.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Imagine a manager (outer function) sets a task. An assistant (inner function) can mark the task as done using `nonlocal`, instead of creating a new copy of the task.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use `nonlocal` when you need to update a variable from an outer (but not global) function inside a nested function.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ‚úÖ Helps maintain state in closures.  
- ‚ùå Can make code harder to read if overused or misunderstood.

## 7. Related Concepts  
- `global` (modifies global scope)  
- Closures  
- Nested functions  
- Variable scoping rules  

## 8. Conclusion  
The `nonlocal` keyword allows inner functions to modify variables from their enclosing (outer) functions, giving developers better control over variable scope in nested functions and enabling more dynamic and stateful function behavior in Python.

## Practical Example

### üîπ 1. Here is an example demonstrating the use of `nonlocal`:

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20
        print("Inner x:", x)
    inner()
    print("Outer x:", x)

outer()
```

### Output:
```
Inner x: 20
Outer x: 20
```

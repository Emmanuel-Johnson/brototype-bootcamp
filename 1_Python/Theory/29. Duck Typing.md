# Duck Typing

## 1. What is Duck Typing?
Duck typing is a feature in Python where the type of an object is less important than the methods it has.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
It lets you write flexible code that works with any object, as long as it behaves the way you expect.

## 3. How Does It Work?
Python doesn‚Äôt check the type‚Äîif an object has the needed method or attribute, it works. This is called "behavior-based" programming.

## 4. Example/Analogy
If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs a duck.

## 5. When Should You Use It?
Use it when your function or code only depends on behavior, not on the exact class of the object.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- **Pros:** ‚úÖ More freedom and cleaner code.
- **Cons:** ‚ùå Risk of runtime errors if the object doesn‚Äôt behave as expected.

## 7. Related Concepts
- Polymorphism (doing the same task in different ways)
- Dynamic typing
- EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)

## 8. Conclusion
Duck typing makes Python powerful by trusting that if something behaves like a duck, we treat it like a duck‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs not officially a "duck."

## üîπ Practical Examples

```python
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof!")
    def move(self):
        print("Running on four legs.")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow!")
    def move(self):
        print("Prowling silently.")

def animal_actions(animal):
    animal.sound()
    animal.move()

dog_instance = Dog()
cat_instance = Cat()

animal_actions(dog_instance)
animal_actions(cat_instance)
```

In this example, the `animal_actions` function does not check if the object is a `Dog` or a `Cat`. It simply calls the `sound()` and `move()` methods. As long as the object passed in has these methods, the function works‚Äîdemonstrating duck typing in Python.

# Data Class

A **dataclass** in Python is a decorator (`@dataclass`) that automatically generates special methods like `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__eq__()` for classes used to store data.

## Why Use Dataclasses?

- **Reduces boilerplate:** Less code when creating classes meant for holding data.
- **Auto-generated methods:** Python creates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and comparison methods based on your fields.

## How It Works

Decorate your class with `@dataclass`. Python will handle the repetitive method generation for you.

## Analogy

A dataclass is like a neatly organized folder: you label the sections (like `name`, `age`, `address`), and Python adds tabs, sorting, and comparison tools for you. It‚Äôs a shortcut that handles the boring paperwork.

## When to Use

Use dataclasses for simple classes that represent structured data, such as `User`, `Product`, or `Point`.

## Pros and Cons

- ‚úÖ Clean syntax, less code, optional immutability (`frozen=True`)
- ‚ùå Limited to data storage; not for complex, behavior-rich classes

## Related Concepts

- `NamedTuple`
- `attrs` library
- `__init__`, `__repr__`
- `typing`

## Conclusion

Dataclasses make Python code cleaner and more maintainable for data-centric classes.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    author: str
    price: float

# Creating an instance
book1 = Book("Atomic Habits", "James Clear", 499.00)

# Displaying the book (uses auto-generated __repr__)
print(book1)

# Comparing two books
book2 = Book("Atomic Habits", "James Clear", 499.00)
print(book1 == book2)  # True
```

# Stack Trace

## 1. What is it?
A stack trace is a report showing the sequence of function calls that led to an error in your program.

## 2. Why it matters
It helps identify where and why an exception occurred, making it easier to debug.

## 3. How it works
When an error happens, Python records the call stack (functions that were called) and shows the file name, line number, and error message.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like reading a breadcrumb trail backward to find where you took the wrong turn.

## 5. When to use it
Use it when exceptions occur, especially during crashes, to trace back the origin of the problem.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ‚úÖ Gives exact location of the error.
- ‚ùå Can be long/confusing in large apps without proper reading.

## 7. Related Concepts
- Call stack
- Exceptions
- `traceback` module
- `try`/`except`
- Error handling

## 8. Conclusion
Stack traces are your first clue during debugging‚Äîread them carefully to locate bugs quickly and accurately.

## üîπ Practical Example

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

def calculate():
    return divide(10, 0)

calculate()
```

**Stack Trace Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 7, in <module>
    calculate()
  File "main.py", line 5, in calculate
    return divide(10, 0)
  File "main.py", line 2, in divide
    return a / b
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

> üß† **Tip:** Start reading the stack trace from the bottom up‚Äîthat‚Äôs where the actual error occurs.

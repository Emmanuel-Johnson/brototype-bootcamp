# Abstraction

Abstraction is a core concept in object-oriented programming that hides complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object.

## 1. What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means representing only the necessary aspects of something while omitting the background details.

## 2. Why is Abstraction Important?
It allows users to interact with objects at a higher level, making code easier to use and maintain without needing to understand internal workings.

## 3. How is Abstraction Implemented in Python?
Python uses abstract classes and methods, typically via the `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module, to define interfaces that must be implemented by subclasses.

## 4. Example / Analogy
Think of driving a car: you use the steering wheel and pedals without needing to know how the engine works.

## 5. When Should You Use Abstraction?
Use abstraction when you want to define a common interface or blueprint for related classes that must implement specific methods.

## 6. Pros and Cons

- **Pros:** Improves modularity and code reusability.
- **Cons:** May introduce slight overhead due to the use of abstract base classes.

## 7. Related Concepts

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Interfaces (in other languages)
- Polymorphism

## 8. Conclusion

Abstraction enables you to build clean, scalable systems by focusing on what an object does, not how it does it.

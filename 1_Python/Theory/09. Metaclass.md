# Metaclass

## 1. What is it?  
A metaclass in Python is a class of a class — it defines how classes themselves behave.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It gives you control over class creation, allowing for powerful customization like validation, auto-modification, or plugin systems.

## 3. How it works?  
When a class is created, Python calls its metaclass to construct it — typically using `type()` or a custom class inheriting from `type`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Think of a factory blueprint that builds other blueprints — a metaclass is like the designer of class templates.

## 5. When to use it?  
When you need to intercept or modify class creation, enforce rules, or add methods/attributes dynamically to many classes.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Extremely powerful.  
- ❌ Can be complex and confusing — avoid unless necessary.

## 7. Related Concepts  
`type`, `__new__`, `__init__`, Class decorators, Object-oriented programming.

## 8. Conclusion  
Metaclasses are advanced tools for controlling class behavior at the blueprint level — useful but best used sparingly.

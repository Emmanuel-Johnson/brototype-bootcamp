# Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

## 1. What is it?
The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.

## 2. Why it matters
It prevents true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound Python programs, affecting performance.

## 3. How it works
Even if you run multiple threads, the GIL ensures that only one thread runs in the interpreter at any given moment.

## 4. Example/Analogy
> Imagine multiple chefs sharing one knife—they have to take turns, even if all want to chop vegetables.

## 5. When to use it
- Use **multiprocessing** (not threading) for CPU-bound tasks.
- Threads are fine for I/O-bound tasks (like network calls).

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ✅ Simpler memory management  
- ❌ Limits multi-threaded CPU performance

## 7. Related Concepts
- CPython
- Threading vs Multiprocessing
- I/O-bound vs CPU-bound
- `asyncio`

## 8. Conclusion
GIL simplifies Python internals but restricts true multi-threaded CPU parallelism—know when to switch to multiprocessing.

Use of Closures

## Closures in Python

Closures in Python are inner functions that remember and have access to variables in the local scope in which they were created, even after the outer function has finished executing. They are a way to bind data to a function without passing it as a parameter.

### Key Characteristics of Closures:
- They are nested functions, i.e., defined inside another function.
- They can access variables from the enclosing scope.
- They remember the values of these variables even when the outer function has completed its execution.
- They are function objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions.

### How Closures Work:
1. An outer function defines a local variable.
2. An inner function is defined within the outer function and uses the local variable.
3. The outer function returns the inner function.
4. When the returned inner function is called, it remembers the value of the local variable from the outer function's scope.

#### Example:
```python
def outer_function(message):
    def inner_function():
        print(message)
    return inner_function

my_func = outer_function("Hello, World!")
my_func()  # Output: Hello, World!
```

In this example, `inner_function` is a closure that remembers the `message` variable from `outer_function`. When `my_func` is called, it prints `"Hello, World!"`.

### Use Cases:
- **Data Encapsulation**: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods.
- **Function Factories**: Closures can be used to create functions that are customized with specific values.
- **Decorators**: Closures form the basis for creating decorators, which are functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions.

### Modifying Variables in Closures:
To modify variables from the enclosing scope, the `nonlocal` keyword must be used.

#### Example:
```python
def outer_function():
    count = 0
    def inner_function():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inner_function

my_counter = outer_function()
print(my_counter())  # Output: 1
print(my_counter())  # Output: 2
```

In this example, the `nonlocal` keyword allows the inner function to modify the `count` variable from the outer function's scope.

### Practical Examples of Closures

#### 1. Data Encapsulation â€“ Private Variable Using Closure
Closures can be used to create private variables that are not accessible directly, ensuring encapsulation.

```python
def make_counter():
    count = 0  # private variable

    def counter():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count

    return counter

counter1 = make_counter()
print(counter1())  # Output: 1
print(counter1())  # Output: 2
print(counter1())  # Output: 3
```

ðŸ”’ `count` is not accessible directlyâ€”only through `counter()`.

---

#### 2. Function Factory â€“ Customized Functions Using Closure
Closures can be used to generate functions with specific internal values, making them highly reusable.

```python
def power_factory(n):
    def power(x):
        return x ** n
    return power

square = power_factory(2)
cube = power_factory(3)

print(square(4))  # Output: 16
print(cube(2))    # Output: 8
```

ðŸŽ¯ `square` and `cube` are generated by the same outer function but with different internal values.

---

#### 3. Decorator â€“ Modify Behavior Using Closure
Closures form the basis of decorators, which allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of other functions.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function runs")
        func()
        print("After the function runs")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

ðŸ§© **Output:**
```
Before the function runs
Hello!
After the function runs
```

This demonstrates how closures power decorators, letting you wrap and modify other functions without changing them directly.

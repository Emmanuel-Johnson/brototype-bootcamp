# Use of Closures

## 1. What is it?  
A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its enclosing scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It allows functions to retain access to external variables, enabling data encapsulation, state persistence, and functional programming patterns.

## 3. How it works?  
When an inner function references variables from its outer function, Python stores those variables in a closure cell, keeping them alive even after the outer function ends.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
A closure is like a playlist you downloaded for offline use — you created it while connected (inside the outer function), picking your favorite songs (variables), and now you can listen to it anytime, even without internet (outside the original scope). The playlist remembers exactly what it needs, just like a closure keeps access to variables from its original environment, no matter where it's used later.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use closures when you need a function with memory, like in decorators, callbacks, or when creating functions with customizable behavior.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
✅ Enables stateful functions without classes.  
❌ Can make debugging harder if overused or misused.

## 7. Related Concepts  
Decorators, Higher-order functions, Lexical scoping, Lambda functions.

## 8. Conclusion  
Closures provide a powerful way to bind data to functions, making your code more modular and expressive.

## Practical Example

```python
def outer_function(msg):
    def inner_function():
        print(f"Message: {msg}")
    return inner_function

# Create a closure
hi_closure = outer_function("Hello, World!")

# Call the inner function
hi_closure()  # Output: Message: Hello, World!
```

## Uses of Closures

### 1. Data Hiding (Encapsulation)  
You can use closures to hide data, just like private variables in classes.

```python
def secret_password():
    password = "admin123"
    def get_password():
        return password
    return get_password

get = secret_password()
print(get())  # Output: admin123
```

The outer variable `password` is not accessible directly — only through the closure.

### 2. Maintaining State (Without Classes)  
Closures allow you to create functions that remember state between calls.

```python
def counter():
    count = 0
    def increment():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return increment

c = counter()
print(c())  # 1
print(c())  # 2
print(c())  # 3
```

---

### 3. Function Factory  
You can create custom versions of a function.

```python
def power(exponent):
    def power_of(n):
        return n ** exponent
    return power_of

square = power(2)
cube = power(3)

print(square(5))  # 25
print(cube(2))    # 8
```

---

### 4. Decorators  
Closures are the foundation of decorators in Python.

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()
```

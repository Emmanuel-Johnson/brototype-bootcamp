# File Handling

## 1. What is it?  
File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and delete files using built-in functions.

## 2. Why it matters?  
It’s essential for working with external data like logs, configs, reports, or datasets.

## 3. How it works?  
You use functions like `open()`, along with file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'b'`), and methods like `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.

## 4. Example/Analogy  
Like opening a notebook to write or read—Python "opens" the file, performs actions, then closes it.

## 5. When to use it?  
Use when your app needs to store or retrieve data from files, such as saving user input or processing data logs.

## 6. Pros and Cons  
- ✅ Easy to use and built-in  
- ❌ Needs proper error handling to avoid crashes or data loss  

## 7. Related Concepts  
- Context managers (`with open(...)`)  
- Exceptions (`try-except`)  
- `os` and `shutil` modules  

## 8. Conclusion  
File handling is a foundational skill for data-driven tasks and automation in Python development.

## Practical Examples 

### 1. Creating a File
```python
# 'w' mode creates a file if it doesn't exist
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a new file.\n")
```

### 2. Writing to a File
```python
with open("sample.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Adding another line to the file.\n")
```

### 3. Reading a File
```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### 4. Reading Line by Line
```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

### 5. Reading as a List of Lines
```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)
```

### 6. Copy Content from One File to Another
```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as source, open("copy.txt", "w") as destination:
    for line in source:
        destination.write(line)
```

### 7. Deleting a File
```python
import os

if os.path.exists("sample.txt"):
    os.remove("sample.txt")
    print("File deleted.")
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

### 8. File Existence Check
```python
import os

if os.path.isfile("sample.txt"):
    print("The file exists.")
else:
    print("File not found.")
```

### 9. Exception Handling While Reading
```python
try:
    with open("missing.txt", "r") as file:
        print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

### 10. Using `with` vs `open/close`
```python
# Using open and close (manual)
file = open("sample.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()

# Using with (automatically closes the file)
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

### Common File Modes

| Mode | Name               | Description                                                                 |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'r'  | Read               | Opens the file for reading (default). File must exist.                     |
| 'w'  | Write              | Opens the file for writing. Overwrites the file if it exists, creates new if not. |
| 'a'  | Append             | Opens the file to append data at the end. Creates the file if it doesn’t exist. |
| 'x'  | Exclusive Create   | Creates a new file. Fails if the file already exists.                      |
| 't'  | Text Mode          | Default mode. Reads/writes text data.                                      |
| 'b'  | Binary Mode        | Reads/writes binary data like images, videos, etc.                        |
| '+'  | Read + Write       | Updates file (both reading and writing). Use with 'r+', 'w+', or 'a+'.     |
### Common File Object Methods

| Method          | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.read()`        | Reads the entire file as a string                             |
| `.read(n)`       | Reads up to `n` characters                                    |
| `.readline()`    | Reads one line at a time                                      |
| `.readlines()`   | Reads all lines into a list                                   |
| `.write(text)`   | Writes the string `text` to the file                          |
| `.writelines(list)` | Writes a list of strings to the file                       |
| `.seek(position)` | Moves the file pointer to a given position                   |
| `.tell()`        | Returns the current position of the file pointer              |
| `.flush()`       | Flushes the write buffer to the file (writes immediately)     |
| `.close()`       | Closes the file                                               |

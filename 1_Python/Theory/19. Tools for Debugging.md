# Tools for Debugging

## print() Statements
A basic but effective way to track variable values and understand program flow.  
Best for quick checks, but not ideal for large applications.

## pdb (Python Debugger)
A built-in interactive debugger.  
Use `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` to pause execution and enter debugging mode.  
Allows stepping through code, inspecting variables, and evaluating expressions.

## IDEs with Debugging Support
Most modern IDEs come with powerful graphical debugging tools like:
- **PyCharm**
- **VS Code**
- **Thonny**
- **Eclipse with PyDev**

These support breakpoints, step execution, variable inspection, watches, etc.

## Logging Module
Provides a better alternative to `print()` for production code.  
- Allows different log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.  
- Helps in filtering and organizing output.

## Third-party Debugging Tools
- **ipdb** – Enhanced `pdb` with IPython features like syntax highlighting and tab completion.  
- **pudb** – A full-screen, TUI-based visual debugger in the terminal.  
- **py-spy** – A sampling profiler for performance bottleneck analysis without modifying code.

## Unit Testing + Debugging
Frameworks like `unittest`, `pytest`, and `doctest` are used for automated testing.  
Help in early bug detection and debugging failed tests.

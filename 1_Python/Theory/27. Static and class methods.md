# Static Methods

## 1. What is a Static Method?
A static method is a method that does not access class or instance data.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
Static methods are useful for utility functions that are logically related to the class but don’t need access to class or instance context.

## 3. How Does It Work?
Static methods are decorated with `@staticmethod` and do not take `self` or `cls` as the first argument.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of a static method like a calculator inside a class—it's useful, but doesn’t depend on any object or class data.

## 5. When Should You Use It?
Use static methods when the logic is related to the class but independent of its instance or state.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ✅ Clear separation of utility logic.
- ❌ Can’t access or modify class/instance state.

## 7. Related Concepts
- Class methods
- Instance methods
- Utility functions

## 8. Conclusion
Static methods are great for stateless helper logic that you want to group with the class for better organization.

# Class Methods

## 1. What is a Class Method?
A class method is a method that receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument instead of the instance.

## 2. Why Does It Matter?
Class methods allow you to operate on the class itself—useful for factory methods or altering class-level state.

## 3. How Does It Work?
Class methods are decorated with `@classmethod` and take `cls` as the first parameter.

## 4. Example/Analogy
Think of a class method like a blueprint tool that can make new objects of the same class using the class itself.

## 5. When Should You Use It?
Use class methods when you need access to class data or want to create instances in alternative ways.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ✅ Can create flexible constructors.
- ❌ Can’t access instance-specific data directly.

## 7. Related Concepts
- Static methods
- Inheritance
- Factory pattern

## 8. Conclusion
Class methods provide powerful ways to work with or construct classes using class-level logic.

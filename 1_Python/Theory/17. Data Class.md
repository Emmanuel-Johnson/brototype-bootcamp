# Data Classes

Data classes in Python, introduced in version 3.7, provide a streamlined way to create classes primarily designed for storing data. They automatically generate essential methods, reducing boilerplate code.

## Key Features

### Automatic Methods
Data classes automatically create methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, among others.

### Type Hints
They work with type hints, enabling static analysis and improved code readability.

### Concise Syntax
Data classes use a decorator (`@dataclass`) to define the class and its fields, making the code more concise.

### Default Values
Fields can have default values, allowing for flexible object creation.

### Mutable Defaults
Special care is needed to handle mutable default values to avoid unexpected behavior, often using `default_factory`.

## Usage

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    city: str = "Unknown"
    hobbies: list = field(default_factory=list)  # Correct way to handle mutable defaults

person1 = Person("Alice", 30, "New York")
person2 = Person("Bob", 25, hobbies=["reading", "hiking"])

print(person1)  # Output: Person(name='Alice', age=30, city='New York', hobbies=[])
print(person2)  # Output: Person(name='Bob', age=25, city='Unknown', hobbies=['reading', 'hiking'])
```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Avoids writing repetitive methods for data-holding classes.
- **Improved Readability**: Clear, concise, and easily understandable code.
- **Type Safety**: Type hints enable static analysis and prevent type-related errors.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that data classes are consistent in how they are initialized, represented, and compared.

## Advanced Features

### Field Customization
Using the `field()` function, you can customize the behavior of individual fields, such as excluding them from the `__init__` or `__repr__` methods.

### Ordering
Data classes can be made orderable, allowing instances to be sorted.

### Immutability
Data classes can be made immutable, preventing changes to their fields after creation.

### Slots
Data classes can use `__slots__`, which can make accessing instance variables faster.

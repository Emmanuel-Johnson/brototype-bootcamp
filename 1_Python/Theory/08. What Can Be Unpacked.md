# What Can Be Unpacked

## 1. What is it?
Unpacking in Python is the process of extracting elements from an iterable (like a list, tuple, or dictionary) into individual variables.

## 2. Why it matters?
It improves readability, simplifies assignments, and is essential in function arguments and looping structures.

## 3. How it works?
Python matches the number of variables on the left to elements in the iterable on the right (supports `*` for collecting extras).

## 4. Example/Analogy
Like unpacking items from a suitcase — you pull out clothes (values) and place them into drawers (variables).

## 5. When to use it?
When assigning multiple values at once, iterating through items, or passing arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

## 6. Pros and Cons
- ✅ Cleaner code and fewer lines.
- ❌ Errors if counts mismatch or structure is unknown.

## 7. Related Concepts
Iterables, Tuples, Lists, `*args`, `**kwargs`, `Enumerate`, Destructuring.

## 8. Conclusion
Unpacking is a versatile Python feature for breaking down iterable data structures into manageable variables with ease.

## Practical Examples

### 🔹 1. Tuple Unpacking
```python
point = (4, 5)
x, y = point
print(x)  # 4
print(y)  # 5
```

### 🔹 2. List Unpacking
```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
first, second, third = colors
print(first)   # red
```

### 🔹 3. Using `*` to Collect Extras
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a, b, *rest = numbers
print(a)     # 1
print(b)     # 2
print(rest)  # [3, 4, 5]

a, *middle, b = numbers
print(middle)  # [2, 3, 4]
```

### 🔹 4. Unpacking in Loops
```python
pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
for num, char in pairs:
    print(num, char)
```

### 🔹 5. Unpacking Dictionary Items
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, "->", value)
```

### 🔹 6. Unpacking with Functions
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

nums = (5, 7)
print(add(*nums))  # 12
```

### 🔹 7. Unpacking in Multiple Assignment
```python
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a  # swap values
print(a, b)  # 2 1
```

### 🔹 8. Keyword Argument Unpacking with **kwargs

```python
def greet(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key} = {value}")

greet(name="Alice", age=25, city="Paris")
```

### 🔹 9. Nested Tuple Unpacking in Python

```python
data = ("Alice", (25, "Engineer"))
name, (age, profession) = data
print(name, age, profession)
```

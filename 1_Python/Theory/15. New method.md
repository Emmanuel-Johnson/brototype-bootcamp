# New Method

## What is it?
`__new__` is a special method in Python that creates a new instance of a class before `__init__` initializes it.

## Why it matters?
It gives you control over the object creation process, which is useful when working with immutable types like `int`, `str`, or `tuple`.

## How it works?
Python first calls `__new__` to create the object, then calls `__init__` to initialize it. It must return an instance of the class.

## Example/Analogy
Think of `__new__` as the act of building a house (creating the object), and `__init__` as decorating it (setting attributes).

## When to use it?
Use `__new__` when subclassing immutable types or when you need to customize instance creation.

## Pros and Cons
- **Pros**: Fine-grained control over object creation.
- **Cons**: Can be confusing and rarely needed.

## Related Concepts
Related to `__init__`, class methods, metaclasses, and object lifecycle.

## Conclusion
`__new__` is rarely used but powerful when you need full control over how objects are created in Python.
